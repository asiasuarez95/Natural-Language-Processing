but place myself at once on board H.M.S. Eden, at Woolwich, on the 1st of July, 1827, having been previously invited to take a passage to the coast of Africa, by her captain, W.F.W. Owen, Esq., who was appointed superintendent of a new settlement about to be established on the island of Fernando Po. The commission with which this gentleman was charged, afforded him peculiar advantages, as he was to retain the command of his ship, independently of the Commodore on the African station, for the purpose of facilitating his operations in the island. I had resolved to visit Sierra Leone, and other places on the western coast of Africa, principally from an early anxiety I felt to explore that part of the world, and also, strange and paradoxical as it may appear, for the benefit of my health. That a man should visit Sierra Leone for the benefit of his health, seems to be as unreasonable as if he were to seek for the vernal airs of the south in the inclement region of Siberia. But, I am strongly inclined to believe, that the apprehensions of European travellers on this subject are often as fatal as the climate that produces them. In my own case, I was not only free from any apprehensions concerning fevers and those diseases which are incidental to a tropical climate, but, having been recommended to try the effects of a warm region, I anticipated an improvement in my general health from a short residence at a spot, which incautious modes of living, in addition to the insalubrity of the climate, have rendered fatal to so many of my countrymen. At the same time, I am not insensible to the fact, that all Europeans are more or less susceptible of those disorders which are prevalent within the Tropics; especially on the western coast of Africa, in Batavia, Trincomalee, and different parts of the West Indies; but it is equally certain that fear is a great predisposing cause of disease, and that the despondency to which most persons give way while they are under the influence of its effects, increases the mortality to a considerable extent. It has been generally observed, that those persons who happen to be so actively engaged in any engrossing pursuit, as to have no leisure for the imagination to work upon their fears, are less liable to the fever, and, if attacked, are better able to encounter its virulence, than the timid and cautious. In the event of an attack, if the patient keeps up his spirits, and prevents desponding thoughts from occupying his mind, there is every reason to hope for a favourable result&mdash;
It will be seen from the following account of the exportation of wine from Madeira, that the demand was rapidly decreasing in 1825, 6, and 7, owing to the causes above mentioned.

Sunday, August 12th, 1827.&mdash;I accompanied Mr. Shortridge to the English Chapel, where the congregation was small, in consequence of the absence of the merchants and their families in the country, during the summer months. The service was performed by the Rev. Mr. Deacon, who is a member of the Established Church, and holds the appointment of Chaplain to the English residents, of whom there are a great number, consisting of merchants, shop-keepers, servants, and a few invalids. I do not, however, consider it the best place in the world for the last description of visitors. Bermuda is well known to be a much more healthy climate; from the land not being so high, the weather is less variable, and the temperature, of course, more equal. Madeira, notwithstanding, has two advantages over Bermuda, worthy of consideration; it presents more agreeable and better society, and offers greater facilities of intercourse with England; so that the accounts from home are more frequent and recent.
Friday, 17th.&mdash;The York, East Indiaman, was lying off this place in the forenoon whilst her boat went on shore with letters. Some of the officers took horse this morning and went to the town of Laguna, which is about six miles from Santa Cruz. They found the road in a terrible state, from a quantity of large stones and rubbish, which a late hurricane, with heavy rain, had brought down from the higher lands. Their ride was a very cheap one, for they only paid half a dollar for each horse, including a guide&mdash;a rare occurrence for Englishmen to find any thing cheap in a foreign country. Port Oratava, which lies on the opposite or north side of the island, the principal town for commerce on it, is 21 miles by land from Santa Cruz; and it is said to be 36 miles from Oratava to the summit of the Peak, a journey of at least two days' ascent from the latter place, which is the starting point.
They have at Teneriffe, (besides horses, asses, and mules,) camels, which are much in use as beasts of burden. Smoking is a very general practice here, and consequently there is no want of ordinary cigars; but I was surprised to find that Havannah cigars are very difficult to be procured. They can be obtained, however, but at un exorbitant rate, in consequence of the risks attending the smuggling. Tobacco is a royal monopoly, and the duty is so high, that it amounts almost to a prohibition, and consequently affords great temptation to smuggling. They have ice at their command here in abundance, which is a great luxury for a hot climate. They bring it down from the mountains, and use it very commonly in lemonade, creams, and for many other purposes. It is desirable to call here on your way to a hot climate, if it were only to procure a few good drip stones, the best of which are brought from Grand Canary, and which are to be had in great plenty, and very cheap, from one to three Spanish dollars each, which is the most current coin of this island.
Teneriffe, in climate, soil, produce, and general appearance, strongly resembles Madeira, from which it is distant 240 miles, due south. The principal towns are Port-Oratava, Oratava, Realexo, and Caracheeo, on the north side of the island; and on the south, Santa Cruz, Candilaria, and Adexi; besides the inland towns, Laguna, (the capital) about two leagues from Santa Cruz, Metanza, and Victoria, all on the road between Santa Cruz and Port-Oratava, which arc at an elevation, varying from 3,000 to 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. This affords a considerable variety of climate, and choice of residence. Teneriffe, however, possesses but little English society, consequently there are few comforts or inducements for invalids. There is an extensive plain of table land and corn country round Laguna, which is a bishop's see, with an income of 30,000 dollars per annum. The governor of the province resides at Santa Cruz. There is also a bishopric at Grand Canary (where the audience, or supreme court is held), worth about 50,000 dollars a-year.
sal sola soda, extensively cultivated at Lanccrota and Forteventura. It is gathered in September, dried, and then charred or fused into a ringing, hard, cellular mass, of a greyish blue colour. A small quantity is made also at Grand Canary. The barilla of the Canary Islands has been sold in England so high as 80l. a ton, and as low as 6l.; at the present time, (December, 1833) it is worth 9l. 10s. a ton. The depreciation is caused chiefly by kelp, and other substitutes found in the British alkali, a French chemical discovery, manufactured from sea salt, from which, the other ingredients are detached, by combination with sulphur, and acids subjected to heat. The imports of barilla from the Canary Islands to this country are about 3,500 tons a-year. The United States of America, and of late years, Brazil, also, take off a few cargoes of this article. Lancerota produces, annually, about 300 tons of barilla; Forte ventura about 1500 tons.
Friday, August 24th.&mdash;Soon after breakfast I accompanied Captain Owen, the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Davy, and some of the officers of the ship, to pass the day at the Consul's. We took a walk before dinner, to visit the few places that were worthy of any notice; we first went to the fort. This fort was forty-seven paces long and seven broad, where the only objects of interest were the graves of two Captains in the Navy. One of them contained the remains of an old shipmate of mine, Capt. J. Eveleigh, who was mortally wounded when commanding the Astrea, in company with the Creole, during an engagement with two French frigates, the Etoile and Sultane, on the 23rd of January, 1814, off the Cape de Verds. I sailed in the same ship with this officer when I first went to sea. He was then junior lieutenant of the Royal George, bearing the flag of Lord Bridport. I met him some years afterwards, when he was lieutenant of the Isis, bearing the flag of Admiral Holloway, on the Newfoundland station, in which ship I was a passenger from England to Newfoundland, on my way to join the Cleopatra, as lieutenant, on the Halifax station. The other grave was that of Capt. Bartholomew, of the Lieven frigate, who died while he was occupied in the survey of these islands. The late Consul-General had been purser of that ship, and, poor fellow, both his grave and that of his wife were made near his former captain's.
The original mode of preparing orchilla, that which was practised by the ancients, is said to have been lost, and many chemical experiments exhausted in vain for its recovery. In 1300, however, it was rediscovered by a Florentine merchant, and from that period preserved as a profound secret, by the Florentines and the Dutch. It appears that the Florentines were not satisfied with keeping the preparation of orchilla a mystery from the rest of the world, but that they endeavoured to lead all inquiry into a false channel, by calling it tincture of turnsole, desiring it to be believed, that it was an extract from the heliotropium or turnsole: the Dutch also disguised it in the form of a paste, which they called
P.S. The port charges at St. Jago are not heavy, as they do not exceed sixteen dollars for a vessel of any size or nation.
Saturday, September 1st, 1827.&mdash;There was a moderate breeze from the S.W. and fine weather to-day. At noon, lat. 9&deg; 20' N. lon. 16&deg; 6' W. Cape Sierra Leone S. 73&deg; E. 173 miles. Imagining that I was avoiding a lady who was intentionally advancing to address me on the quarter deck to-day, I stepped back and measured my length across the gunroom skylight, which, fortunately for me, had a piece of wood lengthways in the middle of it, to rest the sashes on, or I must have paid the officers a visit in their mess-room in a very unceremonious manner; I had however the good luck to escape with a slight bruise.
In the year 1804, the colony of Sierra Leone was attacked by the Native Powers, and a body of blacks to the northward of the Boollam territories was put in motion for the purpose of assisting the other native tribes in overwhelming the white population at Freetown. The King, or Chief of the North, (or, as they call themselves, the Sherbro Boollams,) who has since been known by the name of King George, and through whose territories the hostile tribes must needs pass, being a firm ally of the King of Great Britain, declared that on no account whatever would he permit them to pass through his country to attack a British settlement: and he carried his point so effectually as to render the expedition fruitless. In consequence of the determined and friendly conduct of this Prince, a deputation of whites from Freetown was despatched to him, with an invitation to visit Sierra Leone, which invitation he accepted. While at Freetown, he was crowned with all solemnity by the name of King George. He continued on the most amicable terms with the Government of Sierra Leone until his death, which took place the 19th of May, 1826, at the advanced age, it is said, of upwards of one hundred years, a point which it would be difficult to ascertain accurately, as these people are entirely ignorant of their own ages. Since this period the throne of the Boollams has been vacant; it being now, however, the intention of the people to proceed to the choice of a King, according to their custom; and it being deemed of considerable importance from the vicinity of Boollam to Sierra Leone, that a person should be elected who was known to be friendly to the English settlement, it was determined by his Excellency the Governor that a person should be sent as a commissioner to be present at the election and coronation; whose duty it should be to support the claims and secure the election of a person known to the English by the name of Macaulay Wilson, who, being a near relation of the late King George, and having been educated in England, being also a man of considerable abilities, was deemed in every way worthy of the throne.
&quot;Yougroo, Boollam, March 3rd, 1827.
&quot;The town of Yougroo, I was told, generally contained but about 500 or 600 inhabitants, although, during the election, &amp;c. there must have been, at least, 5000 or 6000 persons present.

September 21st, 1827.&mdash;On this day I attended the Court, to hear the trial to which I have already alluded. It was a case of adultery, and the parties were all free blacks. The action was brought by a carpenter against the Rev. Samuel Thorpe, a preacher at one of the Independent chapels, for criminal conversation with his wife; and, as I have a copy from the records of the Court, I think it will be much more satisfactory to insert the document in full, than to supersede it by any desultory remarks of my own. It will give a clear and characteristic idea of the state of society amongst these people. The occurrence was so unusual, that it created no small astonishment, that such a case should be brought into Court. The following is the address of the plaintiff's counsel, and the verdict.
A statement of the annual export of timber from Tombo, since the commencement in 1816, will shew with what rapid strides the trade has increased.

In this place we discovered a tombstone of the date of 1680, but unfortunately the inscription was illegible.
The brig Atalanta came down the river this morning, and anchored off Freetown, having taken in a cargo of timber at Bance Island. There was not a single vessel left up the river, which was remarked as an extraordinary circumstance, for since the year 1816, when the contract for African timber commenced, such an event had not taken place.
In Freetown alone, there are between 5000 and 6000 coloured men, all of whom are free.

&quot;Sierra Leone, Sept. 18th, 1827.
The original settlers of this colony, we learn from &quot;Murray's Historical Discoveries,&quot; consisted of about four hundred blacks, and sixty whites, (the latter chiefly women of abandoned character,) who arrived at Sierra Leone the 9th of May, 1787. These blacks, as is well known, were part of those that went to Great Britain; having been sent with the white loyalists, among the Bahama Islands, Nova Scotia, and England, at the conclusion of the American war: and twelve hundred more of the same description of American blacks agreed to leave Nova Scotia for Sierra Leone, on terms proposed to them by the Sierra Leone Company, where they arrived in March, 1792: and in December, 1793, Lieut. Beaver arrived at Sierra Leone, with the few survivors that had abandoned the colony of Bulama.
The trade with the nations of the interior is chiefly confined to the Foulahs and Mandingoes, who bring small quantities of gold with them, which they exchange for European articles to carry home. Their mode of travelling to the colony is not a little curious. They first appoint one of their number as head man, who is referred to on every occasion, and who is answerable for the conduct of the whole. They generally come down in numbers of from six to thirty, and sometimes more. Each man carries on his head a kind of basket, made of the rattan cane, in which is contained his shirt, a calabash, some rice, and a bag made of sheep-skin, which holds the alcoran, some rice, bread, a knife, scissors, and other useful articles; also a small pouch in which they carry their gold, averaging about 5l. sterling each person. They secure the bag by fastening the sides of the basket together, and binding it round with strong twine which they make from grass. On the top of the basket they tie their bow and quiver of arrows loosely, so that they can get at them readily, in case they should be attacked in the woods by wild animals, or by any of the different tribes whose settlement they pass through in coming down. They also carry a bamboo cane about six feet long, and three inches in circumference, with a piece of iron, about six inches long, and sharp at the point, fixed into the end of it; this they make use of as a spear. They also carry a long knife or sword, which is slung over the arm by a belt. They partly live on the wild fruits of the country, and occasionally get something at the villages through which they pass; generally walking between the hours of six and ten in the morning, and two and six in the afternoon each day. When they arrive at Porto Logo, (which place is the termination of their land journey) they engage a canoe to take them to Freetown, for which they used to pay four dollars a head, but it is now reduced to one, and this charge they are accustomed to levy afterwards upon the merchant with whom they intend to deal, looking upon it as a bonus included in the traffic. They also apply to the merchants in Freetown, for accommodations during their stay, which is from ten days to a month. They will not trade either on the first or second day, but go round the town examining the different goods in the shops, and ascertaining the prices. In this preliminary proceeding they are assisted by their countrymen, who have been long resident in the colony and are acquainted with the English language. These interpreters make their living by cheating in every possible way, both the poor traveller and the merchant.
Replies to Dr. George Gregory's Queries on Vaccination and Small-pox, Sierra Leone, 24th September, 1827.
Small-pox prevails occasionally, and there are instances of its having occurred even in a confluent form after vaccination: one genuine instance of this kind came under my notice in the year 1824, in the person of a liberated African girl, of about sixteen years of age; vaccination had been performed in this case, by the late Dr. Nicol, Deputy Inspector of Hospitals, and was considered satisfactory; the case proved confluent; the secondary fever was accompanied by a severe diarrhoea, which carried off the patient about the thirteenth day. Another well authenticated instance of the same fact, occurred in the early part of the present year, in the family of a respectable Nova Scotian settler; other cases of a similar nature have been reported by the inhabitants; but I do not consider that, in these cases, the proofs of a pure previous vaccine disease have been satisfactorily established; when vaccination has been carried on for some time, from the same stock of lymph, the disease is apt to degenerate and become spurious, from which cause we require a frequent renewal of lymph from England, in order to keep it in continuous and successful operation; the spurious disease, on the fifth day, generally shews itself in the form of a small globated papula; on the eighth day, it presents sometimes an ash-coloured pustule, containing purulent matter; at other times, and less frequently, a brown-coloured scale, having a small quantity of purulent matter under it, capable of producing, by innoculation, a disease similar to itself; the great prevalence of a disease among the negro population, called &quot;craw craw,&quot; is considered as materially influencing that change in the properties of the pure vaccine lymph, which has been just noticed: that apathy and indolence of which I have already accused the negro population, leads them to consider the appearance of disease in the arm, after vaccination, as the test of safety from small-pox, great as the difficulty sometimes is, in getting them to bring forward their children for vaccination, it is still greater to procure the examinations in its progress and maturation; the mere appearance of disease in the arm, is supposed to carry along with it immunity from small-pox; and, on the occurrence of the epidemic at an after period, it may be easily foreseen how wretchedly and how fatally this confidence in the spurious disease may be misplaced; I, therefore, do not consider, that, in all the cases spoken of among the inhabitants, as cases of small-pox occurring after vaccination, there existed satisfactory proofs of the patient having previously undergone the genuine vaccine disease; yet, I am sorry to say, that from such occurrences as these, vaccination has rather lost ground in the opinion of the negro population.
Thursday, October 4th, 1827.&mdash;At length the day arrived when I was to quit Sierra Leone, and I might say with some regret; for, during my residence there, I had been very hospitably and agreeably entertained by the principal government officers, as well as by several of the most respectable merchants; and I had found a sufficient variety of objects of interest, to yield ample occupation for the mind. I could have desired to remain sometime longer, particularly as the fine weather, and what is called the healthy season, was fast coming on, which would have afforded me more time to examine and reflect on what was of interest to the colony as well as to the mother country; but I was conscious of a feeling of still deeper regret, and of a different character from that of mere curiosity;&mdash;it was the pain of parting from those whose kind sympathy had led them to take more than a common interest in my pursuits, and to whose friendly and constant attentions I was indebted for the advantages I enjoyed while I remained in the colony.
The first efforts of the American Colonization Society were directed to Sierra Leone in 1818, when two Agents were sent there to purchase land for a new colony; on their arrival at their destination, two men of colour, well acquainted with the coast, accompanied them on a voyage of exploration. Having examined all the places which appeared suitable for their purposes, they finally made arrangements for forming the new colony on Sherbro Island, about 100 miles south of Sierra Leone, when one of the agents returned to America, the other having died on his passage. The Society now resolved to fit out an expedition immediately, in which they were greatly aided by the President, the object seeming to be well calculated to promote the political advantages of the United States. The first colonists left America in February, 1820. They consisted of two government agents, one from the society, and eighty-eight persons of colour. These emigrants were very unfortunate: they arrived just at the commencement of the rainy season, the
The town of Monrovia is situated on the inland side of the peninsula, on the S.W. bank of the river Montserado, about two miles within the extremity of the Cape. The original settlement approached within 150 yards of the water, and occupied the highest part of the spiral ridge, which traverses a large part of the peninsula, and rises at this place to about 75 feet. At the time this territory was purchased by the agents of the American Colonization Society, in December 1821, this tract of land was covered by a dense and lofty forest, entangled with vines (a very large description of parasitical plant, so called) and brushwood, which rendered it almost impervious to new settlers.
A small vessel, the prize of an English cruiser, bound to Sierra Leone, and having on board about thirty liberated Africans, put into the roads for water, and had the misfortune to part her cable and run ashore below George's town, where she was in a few hours beaten to pieces by the heavy surf. She was immediately claimed by the natives on behalf of their king, whose alleged rights they came forward to maintain by the force of arms.&mdash;In attempting to board, however, they were opposed and beaten back by the prize-master and his crew. The American settlers, perceiving the extreme danger of their English visitors, hastened to their relief, bringing with them a brass field-piece, which they turned against the assailants, who, terrified by so unaccustomed a mode of warfare, hastily retreated towards their forest-bound hamlet, leaving the English officer, his crew, and the Africans at liberty. The damage on both sides was, however, considerable; on that of the natives it consisted of many wounded men and two killed; on that of the strangers, in the total loss of their vessel, with most part of their stores and property; but on that of the settlers the injury sustained was fatally severe, it consisted of the destruction by fire of their most valuable and requisite stores, amounting in actual worth to three thousand dollars: a loss incalculably increased by their necessities.
From this period the affairs of the colony have rapidly improved. In a short time after peace was restored, sixty-one new emigrants, and a supply of stores, under the charge of Dr. Ayres, augmented the resources of the colonists; but that gentleman was obliged, in consequence of the state of his health, to resign, at the close of 1823, the superintendance of the interests of the colony to Mr. Ashmun, who continued, until the period of his death, to act as principal Colonial Agent to the Society. To Mr. Ashmun's admirable management of the affairs of the colony, much of its contentment and security may be attributed. He purchased from its natural owners, all the territory he occupied; and as not an acre was taken without an equivalent, the natives were well pleased to cultivate an intercourse that was at once so profitable and desirable. In 1825, a number of fresh emigrants arrived, whose pursuits were of an agricultural nature, and as they desired to go into the jungle at once, and commence operations, a negotiation was opened with the neighbouring tribes for the purchase of land. The ground selected was a tract of about twenty miles, varying from one to three miles in breadth, lying on the navigable part of the St. Paul's river. The advantages of this accession of territory, consisted in the opportunity it afforded the settlers of dwelling on their plantations, instead of being compelled to live in the town, at an inconvenient distance from them; in the fertility of the soil, which was sufficiently rich to enable the emigrant to support himself and his family, a short time after his arrival; in making the agricultural settlement more available and compact; and in securing the trade of the St. Paul's river, which was an object of great importance. Subsequently to that period, other additions have been made to the possessions of the colonists; and, at present, the colony extends nearly 150 miles along the coast, and a considerable distance into the interior. The government of the colony commands eight trading stations, established on the purchased land for the convenience of, and intercourse with, the natives, from Cape Mount to Trade Town; and the prospects and advantages of the colonists, are every day improving.
The colonists of Liberia resolved to avoid the error of the parent country. They began by banishing the very name of slave, and they have persisted in their resolution to keep themselves free. Under the provisions of their constitution, the Colonization Society is empowered to make such regulations as may appear requisite for the government of the colony, until it shall withdraw its superintendence, and leave the colonists to govern themselves; the common law, as it is in force in the United States, is applied to the jurisdiction of Liberia. In 1824 a regular plan for the civil government of the colony was drawn up, and a digest of laws framed, which have been approved of, and are now in full operation. By this plan, the Agent is invested with sovereign power, subject only to the decision of the colonial board; municipal and judicial officers are appointed; the choice of certain offices is vested in the colonists, subject to the approval of the Agent; and standing committees of agriculture, of public works, of colonial militia, and of health are appointed, whose duties are clearly defined and rigidly enforced.
The remarkable success which crowned the efforts of the settlers in Liberia, has subsequently led to the consideration of more extensive plans for the establishment of colonies for liberated slaves. Of course, in proportion as the circle of manumission is enlarged, the provision for the future welfare of the emancipated blacks must he increased:&mdash;with a double view, therefore, not only to prepare adequate settlements for their reception, but by the exercise of an active liberality to encourage the spirit of freedom which was found difficult of accomplishment at first, but which ultimately yielded to the energies of the opponents of the slave trade in America. Many attempts had been made in the United States to abolish, or at all events diminish the practice of slavery, bat in vain; for it appears, however startling and apocryphal the statement may seem, that the English Government, during the period that they exercised sovereignty in the Union, always refused to sanction the abrogation of slavery. Even so far back as 1698, the mother country rejected a proposition made by the assembly of Pennsylvania, to levy a duty of 10 per cent. per head on the importation of slaves; which was intended to operate as a prohibition. Indeed, one of the proximate causes of the Declaration of Independence (July 1776) was the unrestricted introduction of slaves. Soon after the American war had terminated, it was suggested as an appropriate measure, in fulfilment of views which had been so long defeated by the influence of English authority, to establish a colony on the coast of Africa, but the continued pursuit of the degrading traffic by almost all the powers of Europe, prevented the benevolent projectors from carrying their design into effect. Twenty years afterwards, the plan was revived, and the most strenuous exertions were made in the different States to organize a body of opinion, which should finally triumph over the self-interests and reluctant morality of the slave-owners. At this period, one of the difficulties which the philanthropic abolitionists experienced was the want of a suitable refuge for such slaves as they might be enabled to liberate. The legislature of Virginia, which contains nearly one-third of the black population of the Union, pledged itself to release all its slaves, if Congress would undertake to provide an adequate asylum for them. President Jefferson negotiated in vain for a territory in Africa, and the Brazils. The legislature of Virginia again renewed its pledge, and as much of the bigotry of former times had now been obliterated by the diffusion of enlightened principles, the renewal of the proposition was followed by the best results. General Mercer, familiarly designated as the Wilberforce of America, opened a correspondence with the principal advocates of emancipation, which ultimately produced the formation of the American Colonization Society, on the first of January, 1817. The labours of the Society were greatly facilitated by the laws of the Union, which left to each State the uncontrolled power of legislating for itself on the subject of slavery. The members of the Society had therefore merely to address themselves to the humanity and understanding of the slaveowners, in order finally to attain their purpose. The progress of moral truth, however slow, is always certain, and the issue of those proceedings has been such as the excellence of their object might have led us to anticipate. Several of the States have already signified their willingness to forego all the pernicious advantages of slavery. And the number of slaves offered gratuitously by owners in different parts of America, vastly exceed the present means of the Society to provide for them in Africa. The legislature of Maryland appreciate so highly the utility and importance of the settlement of Liberia, that they have voted in the first instance a considerable sum, to be appropriated annually to its support, and have subsequently, within the last six months, voted two hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of assisting in the formation of another settlement on the same principles.
It is, therefore, sufficiently evident, that what is now required to complete the united objects of manumission and colonization, is, not so much the consent of the slave-owners, as the power of carrying the design into operation. Mr. Elliot Cresson, of Philadelphia, an active and enthusiastic supporter of the cause, visited England in 1832, for the purpose of drawing attention to the subject, and of appealing to the well-known generosity of a country that has uniformly taken the lead in advancing the interests of civilization. A Society was formed, under the patronage of H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex, with the view of extending colonization in Africa, on the same system which has proved so successful in the case of Liberia. The subject, unfortunately, did not excite the attention which might have been anticipated, partly, I fear, because it was ill-timed, and was considered by the general body of Abolitionists, as a diversion tending to distract the public mind from the great question of emancipation, which was then undergoing anxious discussion; and partly, because it was considered by some, as a palliative likely to prolong the existence of slavery, in the same ratio as it diminished its evils. The selection of so unseasonable a moment for introducing the subject to the public, was influenced by the necessity Mr. Cresson was under of returning to the United States, but previously to his departure, the objections to the efforts of the Society were fully answered, and the important fact of the independence of each State, in reference to slavery, was stated in ample detail. From those statements it appeared, that the law of slavery, in some cases, prohibits&mdash;not only the emancipation; but the education of slaves, in order to render their bondage still more hopeless and oppressive: but that the efforts of the Society were gradually abating the rigour of those cruel restrictions. The Society has hitherto endeavoured, as far as its powers would permit, to extend the principle of colonization, by removing, invariably, with their own consent, such slaves as have the good fortune to obtain their freedom, to a spot where they were not only free from competition with the white population, but where their education, imperfect as it might have been, rendered them the superior instead of the inferior class: thus silently promoting the blessings of Christianity and civilization amongst the native tribes. Mr. Cresson, during his residence in England, distributed several illustrative documents, sanctioned by names of distinguished persons in the United States, and to which I am indebted for some of these particulars. From these documents, were there even no other evidence, it may be fairly inferred, that Liberia affords uncontrovertible proof of the practicability of establishing colonies on the African coast, composed of persons of the African race, nearly, if not wholly, freed from the control of the whites; that the expense of establishing such a colony is moderate, not having exceeded, in the case in point, 4000l. per annum; that it is greatly favoured by the natives, with whom the colonists are rapidly extending their commercial and friendly relations to their mutual benefit; that it has not only placed a large number of manumitted slaves in a prosperous situation, but led to the emancipation of many, who must otherwise have still continued in bondage; and, finally, that it has completely put an end to the slave-trade in the immediate neighbourhood of the settlement, where that nefarious traffic was hitherto most extensively prosecuted. It is to be deplored, that although Great Britain has recently made a noble effort to abolish slavery in her own dominions, there are other countries which still sanction a usage so degrading to our age and religion. But a very short time since, several vessels were captured, the united cargoes of which amounted to a thousand slaves, and when we refer to the large proportion which the liberated Africans bear to the rest of the population in Sierra Leone, equal to about three-fourths of the whole, and consider the heavy expense at which this country endeavours to fulfil the serious responsibility it has taken upon itself in the liberation of these unfortunate captives, I am persuaded that all the particulars which can be collected respecting Liberia, will be deemed worthy of the most serious attention. My readers, therefore, will not, I trust, think that I devote too much space to the subject, if I close my rapid sketch of the progress and fortunes of this settlement, with the latest information respecting it, which has been received in Europe. It is of a very recent date, and is from the pen of Dr. Mechlin, the Governor of Liberia:&mdash;
Monday, Oct. 8th, 1827.&mdash;Light airs and variable, with frequent heavy showers. Land in sight, bearing N.E. At noon calm and very hot. Lat. 5&deg;. 32'. N. lon. 10&deg;. 17'. W. Cape Palmas E.S.E. 168 miles. Hoisted in the pinnance, which we had been towing all the way from Sierra Leone, in consequence of the crowded state of the ship.
It was my intention to have visited their country, had not the Eden proceeded so soon to Fernando Po, but as I was very anxious to be present at the first operations in the formation of our establishment on that island, I reluctantly abandoned my design. Any person would be quite safe in the Kroo country, who would place himself under the guidance of one of their respectable headmen, and Englishmen in particular might visit the interior of their country under great advantages, as the people are well acquainted with them in consequence of the trade which is carried on in ivory, at their own towns on the coast, as well as the intercourse which is constantly kept up with Sierra Leone. There have occasionally been upwards of 2000 of these people at one time in Freetown; but, shortly before our arrival, an order in council was issued to restrict the resident Kroomen to 600, for the purpose of throwing open the labour market to the free blacks, as well as to prevent in some measure the drain of profit which the Kroomen caused by their frequent immigration and departure. Notwithstanding a great proportion of what they earned was expended on articles of British manufacture, which they took away with them, still a material injury was sustained by their constant robberies, which more than counterbalanced the benefit of their expenditure. Independently of this political motive for restricting their numbers, it was useful as a measure of social protection. They resided by themselves in a suburb of the town, apart from the rest of the inhabitants, and used to emerge at night from their close retreats, and commit the most daring burglaries. The stolen property was carefully secreted in their own quarter, where they had a much better opportunity of concealing it than if they dwelt promiscuously in the town at large. They frequently stole calves, pigs and poultry, always adopting the precaution of immediately dressing them, and burning the hides or feathers, as well as any of the offal, that might probably lead to detection. In consequence of these practices their moral character was very low at Freetown, but as they were active, muscular, and intelligent, they obtained a decided preference as servants and labourers. Some of them were also usually employed as sailors in nearly all vessels that remain on the coast. One very remarkable trait in these people is the bond of close union that keeps them together, and preserves an interest in common throughout the whole fraternity. If one of them should commit a crime, it is a very rare occurrence to find another informing, or bearing witness against him; and they carry this principle of combination so far, that they will rather suffer for the offender than denounce him. If the authorities attempt to elicit the facts by a course of examination, they only obtain subterfuges and prevarications, and seek in vain by threats or promises to shake the constancy of the witnesses. The headmen manage their rogueries with so much ingenuity that charges can very seldom be proved against them. They send out their apprentices, under particular instructions, to commit robberies, and, like the Spartan youths, they consider the most expert thief to be the cleverest fellow: should any of these young men be caught, they are left to get out of the scrape in the best manner they are able, for unless it be to swear falsely to an alibi, or some other evasion of truth, their masters never appear in the affair afterwards.
Five leagues to the westward of Cape Three Points, is Axim, where the Dutch have a fort; and about one league further to the westward is the mouth of the river Ancobra. Six leagues to the eastward of Cape Three Points, is Dix Cove, where we had a fort occupied by a small detachment of the Royal African Corps. At half past eight in the evening, we anchored for the night in 15 fathoms water, for fear of running past Cape Coast roads before daylight, the currents being very irregular; and, early on the following morning, we proceeded on our voyage. At 9 o'clock we were abreast of the Dutch fortress of Elmina, which is 7 miles to the westward of Cape Coast Castle, off which place we came to an anchor about 10 o'clock, in 9 fathoms water. We found the African steam-boat, and the Diadem transport, waiting our arrival; there was also an English merchant brig in the roads, but we heard nothing of our schooner. At noon saluted his Honour the Lieut.-Governor, on his leaving the ship, taking his secretary and myself with him in the canoe, which was a fine boat, pulling 17 paddles: we were seated on chairs, fixed to a platform in the forepart of the boat. The castle saluted the Lieut.-Governor on landing, and the shore was lined with natives to receive him. The surf not being very high, we were enabled to land without a wetting, which is rarely the case. On entering the castle, I was introduced to the officers of the garrison, and to Capt. Hutchison, a merchant of this place, who is well-known for his eminent services in this country. The first thing that brought him into particular notice was being associated with Messrs. James and Bowdich, in their mission to the King of Ashantee, in 1817. He was left at Coomassie, the capital of that kingdom, as the accredited British agent, after the departure of the mission, on their return to Cape Coast. The King of Ashantee was pleased with his remaining, for it not only shewed the confidence he had in him, but it was a proof of the sincerity of our intentions, by thus leaving him as a pledge for the fulfilment of our part of the treaty that had just been negotiated; and the forfeiture of his life would, no doubt, have been the consequence, if the King had even suspected any breach of faith on our part. In this situation he remained several months, without the society of any white man, among savages, who think no more of the life of a human being, than a vicious boy does of a dog or cat. Some time after his return from this mission, Capt. Hutchison was called upon to serve in a military capacity against the very nation where all his efforts had been directed to preserve a pacific disposition: and we here find him no less distinguishing himself in the field of proud honour, with his sword in his hand, than he had done in his diplomatic character; for, notwithstanding he had an important command assigned to him, he was personally engaged in almost every battle, in one of which (at Affatoo) he was severely wounded in both arms, and before these wounds were healed, he was called upon to take command of the centre hill on the lines at Cape Coast, when it was attacked by the Ashantees, and all the nations that the powerful king of that country was in alliance with.
There is a singular old man, upwards of 60 years of age, at Cape Coast Castle, who is well known by the name of Dr. Saguah, and who acts in the capacity of a native doctor. This person excites a great deal of attention, not only by the peculiarity of his manners, but by the circumstances through which he has reached a station of some consideration. He was originally a slave to the African Company at Cape Coast, and having been accidentally placed in the house of the medical establishment, he learned to compound medicines. In the duties which he performed in this capacity he rendered himself very useful, and continued at the pestle and mortar until Sir Charles McCarthy's arrival, when the African Company was dissolved, all their slaves liberated, and the new charter proclaimed, (for Sierra Leone and Cape Coast) on March 29, 1822. Having received his freedom, he now assumed a position of some importance, and was retained on the medical establishment as dispenser, with a small salary. His excellent conduct and judgment in the discharge of his new office procured him the general respect and confidence of Europeans, and his reputation, when I was at Cape Coast, stood so high that he was frequently consulted on the diseases of the climate in preference to medical gentlemen from Europe. He is in the habit of making daily visits to all the European residents, whether they require his services or not, and they generally invite him to take some refreshment, handing him at the same time the keys of their celeret or cupboard, that he may help himself to spirits, or wine. He sometimes avails himself of their offer, chiefly for the sake of gratifying his vanity, by shewing to the servants the confidence that is reposed in him; for no other native, perhaps, except himself, would be entrusted with the keys of any place where wine and spirits are kept. Trade was very dull during my stay at Cape Coast, and had been so for some time; the merchants, however, looked forward to its revival, in consequence of the prospects of peace with the Ashantee people, who were very desirous to terminate hostilities, for the sake of being enabled to resume their commercial intercourse with the English, and other Europeans on the coast. During the war it was believed that they had accumulated a great quantity of gold and ivory, which are the principal articles they barter for goods of European manufacture, and for which they had no sale while hostilities lasted, except in some few instances, where individuals risked the hazard of embarking in smuggling transactions.
The battle of Essamacow, which is registered in the Gold Coast Almanack, with the significant prefix of &quot;fatal,&quot; was fought on the 21st of January, 1824. Hostilities commenced about two o'clock in the afternoon, when both parties opened a brisk fire across a small river, that separated their forces. Our troops consisted of only a few regulars, a small body of militia, and some irregular native allies, the whole commanded in person by his Excellency Sir Charles McCarthy, Governor of Sierra Leone.
reply of the General to the messenger&mdash;&quot;Stop till Friday, when the white men are going to attack us: then you can carry back to the King the news of what you see, and of what the young men have to do.&quot; Friday came in due course, and the army of the Ashantees went forward to redeem the pledge of their exulting General. This was the battle of Affatoo, which took place on the 21st of May, 1824. The result was disastrous to the cause of the King. The natives were completely routed and driven from the scene of action, without the loss of a single officer on our side, and with but one wounded (Capt. Hutchison), who commanded the Annamaboe militia, and who was shot through both arms, while he was leading his men to the charge.
The Anglo-Fantee army, immediately after the battle of Affatoo, fell back on Cape Coast Castle, as had been previously arranged by Colonel Sutherland, who had arrived from Sierra Leone just before the battle. This movement of that portion of our troops, enabled Major Chisholm, who possessed the entire confidence of all the soldiers, to take the command in the field. The King of Ashantee, now joined the army, which he headed in person, and concentrating all his forces, he advanced towards Cape Coast Castle with the intention of blockading the town. On the 10th of June, 1824, he pitched his gorgeous pavilion,[23]
At length the eventful day arrived on the 11th of July, 1824. In order to understand the peculiar perils which our army had to encounter, it is necessary to observe that Cape Coast Castle stands near the sea, and that the town is built on the west side of it, at a short distance from the beach. Upon three conical hills that arise close to the back of the town, and run nearly parallel with the coast, our troops were stationed. The right hill was occupied by Major Chisholm's division, the left by Major Purden's, and the centre by Captain Hutchison's; while the subordinate officers commanded the passes between the valley and the town, which were four in number, two beyond the hills, and two between them. These passes were choked up with a dense jungle. The whole army was commanded by Colonel Sutherland, assisted by Sir John Phillirnore, and most of the officers, seamen, and marines, of H.M.S. Thetis.
From this period a cessation of arms followed; but the Ashantees becoming turbulent again, martial law was proclaimed on the 6th of June, 1826. Affairs were in this position, when the battle of Dodowah was fought on August 7, 1826, between the English, assisted by the native allies, and the Ashantees, with their allies, commanded in person by the king, commonly known by the designation of the Tiger-King.
The Ashantees lost in this engagement the whole of their camp baggage, including a great quantity of gold. Towards the evening a number of prisoners were made, for our allies, tired of slaughter, contented themselves with making as many prisoners as they could for slaves. They were supposed altogether to have lost 5000 men, amongst whom were most of the principal chiefs, and the King himself was wounded. One of his wives (to whom Mr. Bannerman introduced me at Accra) and a female child were taken prisoners. Our loss was comparatively trifling, not amounting to more than 800 killed, and 1600 wounded. Colonel Purden received a contusion on the higher part of his right leg, from a spent shot, and Mr. Richter received a shot through one of his thighs. Amongst the deaths, there were three native chiefs, who commanded in our lines.
Saturday, Oct. 20th.&mdash;At eight this morning we left Cape Coast Roads with a fine breeze, for Accra, a distance of sixty miles by sea, and eighty-five by land. A sketch, of the land route may not be uninteresting. Four miles eastward of Cape Coast is Moree, and the Dutch Fort Nassau; six miles from Moree is Annamaboc, the most complete fortification in the country; five miles from thence Cormantine, the first fort possessed by the English, and built by them about the middle of the seventeenth century. It was taken afterwards by the Dutch, and being stormed, was almost destroyed by the Ashantee army, before it attacked Annamaboe; the position is very commanding. Tantumquerry, a small English fort, is about eighteen English miles from Cormantine (crossing the small river Amissa, an hour's walk inland from which is Mankasim, the capital of the Braffoe district of Fantee), the natives call the town Tuam; eight miles from Tantumquerry is the town of Afram, where there is a Dutch fort, and a small river; eight miles from Afram is Simpah or Winnebah. The people of Simpah are Fantees, but their language is called Affoottoo. They are in the district of Agoona. About nine miles from Simpah is the Dutch fort Berracoe; the natives call the town Leniah. Attah, of Akim, laid a contribution on this fort in March 1811. About twenty-seven miles from Berracoe is Accra or Inkran, once subject to Aquamboo, which people, according to Isert, formerly drove them to Popo.
Mr. Thomas Park, who left England, as one of the Midshipmen of the Sybille, but with three years leave of absence from his ship so soon as she arrived on the coast, ordered by the Admiralty for the express purpose of travelling in Africa, with the avowed intention of endeavouring to discover the course, and source of the Niger, was landed at Accra some time since from that ship, and passed a short time there in studying some of the languages of the countries through which he meant to travel. He left Accra to proceed on his journey into the interior on the 29th of September, 1827, and arrived at Mampong in Aquapim on the 2nd of October; this he left on the 5th for Acropong, the chief town of Aquapim, and on the 10th left Acropong, for Aquambo, a town at the head of the Volta river, where he arrived on the 16th of October. I heard that he had been kindly treated, so far as he had penetrated, but at the last mentioned place, he took a fancy to climb a particular tree, which the natives entreated him to desist from, saying that it was Fetished,[27]
The island of Fernando Po, situated off the western coast of Africa, in the Gulf or Bight of Biafra, between 3&deg;. and 4&deg;. N. latitude, and 8&deg;. and 9&deg;. E. longitude, is about one hundred and twenty miles in circumference. It is generally believed to have been discovered in the year 1471, by a Portuguese navigator, who gave it the name of Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Isle, afterwards changed for that of its discoverer, which it now retains. The Portuguese first established a settlement upon it which they, however, abandoned, and subsequently transferred the right of possession to Spain, receiving in exchange the Island of Trinidad, off the coast of Brazil.
In the year 1764, a new settlement was founded by Spain, which, after a lapse of eighteen years, was also abandoned, for causes which have not been satisfactorily explained, although it is generally believed that a series of misunderstandings with the natives took place, which principally produced that result.[29]
To carry the proposed object into effect, an expedition was fitted oat in the early part of the summer of 1827, under the command of Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen, of His Majesty's ship
Monday, Dec. 17.&mdash;The Diadem, which sailed on Saturday, was detained during the whole of yesterday within sight of the island; but, about noon to-day, a fresh wind springing up from the eastward, she was soon out of sight. A few days since, our gardener, while digging in Paradise, turned up a Spanish copper-coin of Charles III., dated 1774, probably a relic of some ship which had touched here for water.
Tuesday, January 1, 1828.&mdash;During the past week nothing of importance has occurred, excepting that our works are rapidly advancing; as respects our general pursuits, and intercourse with the natives, much sameness must necessarily exist.
Wednesday, January 23, 1828.&mdash;Fortunately the wind was light, for had it blown hard, the result might have been fatal to the vessel. At seven in the morning, we found the vessel afloat, and attempted, with a small anchor and cable, assisted by the sails, to get her over the mud: but, at eleven o'clock, we were again stuck fast. In the afternoon, we sent a letter by a Krooman, in a small canoe, to Captain Cumings, of the brig Kent, lying off the town of Old Calabar, commonly called Duke's Town, as the king of that country is generally known by the name and title of Duke Ephraim. In about a couple of hours, the Krooman returned, in consequence of having met with a very large canoe coming down on her passage to the Camaroon river, to purchase slaves. He induced the Captain to come on board, but the appearance of a schooner, with so large a boat and so many hands, evidently created some suspicion in his mind. He was too much a man of the world, however, not to affect a confidence, which we were all persuaded he did not feel:&mdash;he drank some rum, and carried himself with consummate self-possession; gave us all the Calabar news he could recollect, and demanded our latest intelligence in return. When the conversation was exhausted, and a good opportunity occurred for taking leave, he departed; heartily rejoiced, no doubt, at escaping with so much tact. His canoe was about fifty feet long, with a small thatched house built on a platform in the centre. The paddles were worked by boys, under the direction of two men, who gave out a song when pulling. There were two poor creatures, whom we supposed to be slaves, confined in irons, at one end of the boat.
Shortly before our arrival a circumstance occurred which serves to illustrate King Peppel's good-nature and forbearance. About the middle of December, 1826, Capt. Lawrenson, a slave agent, arrived at the Bonny, to purchase a cargo of slaves, which he accomplished in about two months, and sent them away to the West Indies, remaining behind himself, with a quantity of goods to make further purchases, having written his owners to send vessels, and take the slaves away. In the meantime he contrived to ingratiate himself so much with King Peppel, that His Majesty allowed him to live in his house, and consulted his opinion, upon all matters of importance, relative to the white people. Many months elapsed before any vessel arrived, but when they did, the slaves were not ready, and the King continued to delude him with promises for two months longer, at the end of which period, finding his hopes still unrealized, the impatient Frenchman became enraged at what he considered the King's deceit, and resolved on taking summary vengeance. Accordingly, one evening, he went on shore with a cigar in his mouth, and a few squibs in his pocket, when he deposited the latter in the thatch of several houses, and set fire to them. The huts being composed of bamboo, palm-leaves, and reeds, soon burst into a flame, which spread so rapidly in all quarters, that nearly the whole town was destroyed. The people were greatly exasperated and wished to kill the Frenchman, who had not attempted to effect his escape, but King Peppel forbade them to injure a hair of his head, permitting him to return to his vessel, which immediately sailed for France; the Captain still vowing vengeance against the King, and threatening to return with a much larger vessel, well armed, to commit greater ravages, and to carry off all he could lay his hands on, until he considered that he had received compensation for the fraud which he averred had been practised upon him.
Many of them were planted in December, 1827.
Saturday, May 17, 1828.&mdash;Mr. Craig, who had come from Sierra Leone to set up a store, went into the country with a native chief this afternoon, for the purpose of procuring palm-oil. He returned, however, the next evening, very much fatigued and disappointed; for he not only found the journey very harassing, in consequence of the badness of the paths, but discovered that his mercantile project was fruitless, owing to the poverty of the natives. Indeed, the people of Fernando Po are less abundantly supplied with provisions than the nations of Africa in general; their principal dependance being on yams, which are, of course, liable to occasional failure. They have very little live stock of any kind, and the chiefs alone appear to indulge in the luxury of animal food. It is only on particular occasions, however, that they treat themselves to a goat, or sheep, as they are principally confined to fowls. That they are not plentifully supplied with fish, is owing solely to their own negligence, as there are abundance to be had by those who take the trouble of toiling for them; but for many days together, not a canoe was to be seen. It is difficult to ascertain the cause of this strange indifference; it may be that they are afraid to venture out to sea, and this is not unlikely, as they appeared, on our first arrival, to entertain much apprehension at the sight of a strange vessel on their coast; but, as they became accustomed to our presence, and began to entertain a feeling of confidence and protection in our friendship, this diffidence gradually wore off. It cannot be doubted, that their island has often been visited by vessels engaged in the slave-trade, as well as by men-of-war. A circumstance occurred a few years ago, which proves that they are not without hostile visitors; and which, in some measure, justifies the suspicions with which they regard all strangers. In the year 1820, or 1821, a Spanish vessel came over from the Camaroon river to this island, accompanied by King Aqua, with a number of war canoes, for the purpose of decoying the natives, or, in the event of failing in their artifice, to adopt hostile measures, with the ultimate view of seizing upon all they could capture, and selling them for slaves. They accordingly landed well armed, but met with a stout resistance, which proved, however, unavailing, the invaders succeeding in making about 150 prisoners, whom they carried off to the West Indies, and killing as many more in the skirmish. It is supposed that King Aqua received very little reward for his services on the occasion, or for the loss his subjects sustained in the fight. This anecdote was related to me by Captain Cumings, of the Kent, who was trading on the opposite coast for palm-oil, at the time it occurred.
Thursday, 12.&mdash;At 10 in the forenoon we tacked to the southward in hopes of falling in with the brigantine, which we supposed had stood toward the land in the night, and at noon our expectations were realized: we also saw her in a more favourable point for pursuit, she being a little under our lee. Finding that she could not escape us, she put a good face on the matter, and continued to stand towards us. Between one and two o'clock we sent a boat's-crew on board to examine her. She proved to be the Emprendadora, a Spanish brigantine from the Havannah, well armed, mounting one long eighteen-pounder on a swivel, and four 12 lb. carronades, and having thirty-two persons on board. Her outfit and general appearance were extremely suspicious, for she had not only a slave-deck, with irons, &amp;c., but also two slaves, secreted in the forehold, from whom we learnt that they had been stolen from Po-Po, near Wydah. She had also a quantity of merchandise on board, without having any Custom-house certificate of clearance from the Havannah, or indeed any other account of it, which circumstances led us to believe that it had been plundered from some American vessel. It was evident that she had been along the Gold Coast, and round the Bights of Benin and Biafra. The Captain stated that he was going to Prince's Island to procure anchors, having only one remaining, and that one, with but a single fluke to it. We afterwards learnt from the crew that he had endeavoured to enter the river Lagos, but had been fired on and forced to retire, by several Brazilian vessels lying there at the time. We conjectured that she had left the West Indies, on a pretence of going to the coast of Africa, upon a slaving voyage, without any cargo, except perhaps a small quantity of specie, in dollars and gold, but carrying an efficient crew, composed of persons from various nations, and a good stock of provisions. Vessels, thus equipped, frequently traverse these seas, and being generally very fast sailers, they contrive to keep away from ships better armed than themselves, and to board only those that they can approach, or run away from, at convenience; when convinced that they are not likely to encounter any resistance, they plunder such vessels at their pleasure: but should they arrive on the coast of Africa, without having succeeded in obtaining plunder on their voyage to enable them to purchase slaves, they entrap and steal such negroes as they can get into their power, and then return to the West Indies to dispose of their slave cargo. This is the general character of these pirates, that are occasionally met in different parts of the North Atlantic Ocean, and also about the equinoctial line. I have heard numerous instances of vessels, from Europe, bound to these latitudes, meeting on their voyages with one or more of such vessels. Prison ships going to New South Wales have been followed by them; and scrutinized with spy glasses from their decks: but they have never yet ventured to attack a prison-ship, the sight of soldiers being quite enough to deter them from any hostile attempt. Indeed, I believe the best plan in meeting these marauders is, to assume as bold an air, and make as much show of resistance as possible. Knowing the character of these craft, Captain Owen thought it right to detain the brigantine, and therefore sent Lieut. Robinson, Mr. Wood, midshipman, and twenty-two men, to take her into Sierra Leone, for adjudication. In the evening we parted company, but expected to find her at our rendezvous in Prince's Island.
Sunday, 15.&mdash;After divine service, I accompanied Captain Owen in a walk to a negro village, about two or three miles distant, and to which there was no distinct road, but merely a rough irregular path. There was little of interest to be seen there, and scarcely any refreshment to be procured; the blacks brought us a few young cocoanuts, of which we drank the milk. The only fruits to be had on the island, were pine-apples, plantains, bananas, lemons, limes, and a few more common kinds, all of which the blacks brought to the ship in their own boats; as also vegetables, namely, pumpkins, onions, cucumbers, tomatos, &amp;c. The oranges do not come into season until September. The principal plantations were mandioc and coffee, and there was also a small quantity of cocoa; the coffee is rather celebrated for its flavour and quality. The prices vary a good deal, but we found the average from eight to twelve pounds for a dollar. The natives both roast, and sell, their coffee with a pellicle over the berry, and I should imagine it is to this circumstance that its singularly delicious flavour may be attributed. We found the place very gay, it being the festival of St. Antonio, the patron saint, which, considering it is a Portuguese town, and situated in such a demi-civilized part of the world, may be called rather a neat one. It contained about twelve hundred houses, and seven churches, most of these, however, were in a miserable state. There were not more than fifty Europeans on the island, the whole population of which does not exceed four thousand. The principal part of these were negroes, who, of course, were slaves[39], and the remainder were of different shades from black to white. This island has still the character of slave-dealing, in a small way, with some of the African nations. One of the gentlemen of the Eden, rode across the island to West-bay, about six miles distant, but the road was a mere footpath, and scarcely entitled to be considered a bridle-road. West-bay is where our men-of-war, on the African station, generally anchor to procure water. It is a place of no consequence, in a mercantile point of view, as it consists merely of a small negro village. We heard that the great merchant, Mr. Ferraro, had been at his house in town to-day, but he left it again without having shewn the courtesy to return Captain Owen's visit; perhaps, he feared that such an effort of politeness might lead to a demand upon his hospitality, a virtue for which the Portuguese are not very remarkable, especially in their intercourse with Englishmen; in this respect, the Governor was no less a niggard of his attentions than the rest of his countrymen, giving no invitation either to Capt. Owen or any of his officers, whose ceremonious visit cost him, no doubt, infinite annoyance, as, upon that occasion, his Excellency was obliged to appear clean shaved, and in his full uniform, a laborious sacrifice to cleanliness and grandeur, at the expense of his accustomed habits of luxurious indolence and personal ease.
After dinner Lieutenant Badgeley, Dr. Burn, and Lieutenant Carrington of the Marines, left us to return by way of Regent Square, to the Eden. These three gentlemen have all, since that time, paid the debt of nature on board that ship. I accompanied Mr. Butter round the side of the Mountain to the Black Rock, beneath which stretched a wide and deep valley. In this walk we passed various spots set apart for the cultivation of vegetables, to which the soil is exceedingly favourable, while the deposition of night dews, with light showers, and a genial climate, all combine to render vegetation here peculiarly luxuriant, so that the inhabitants are not only enabled to reserve an ample supply for themselves, but to spare a small quantity for most of the ships that call at the island. Colonel Nichols informed us that he had 1000 lbs. weight of vegetables, principally the sweet potatoe, ready to dispose of at this period. We had at dinner green peas, and French beans, besides the more common vegetables, likewise turnip-radishes with our cheese. In fact all European vegetables may be, and most of them are, produced here. The greatest range of the thermometer on the mountain in the winter months, which are August, September, October, and November, is from 58&deg; to 70&deg;, and in the summer from 70&deg; to 82&deg;, consequently the greatest range of the whole year is only 24&deg; being from 58&deg; to 82&deg; F. The sweet potatoe, (of which there are a great many and very large[47]) was first brought here from Africa; the best method of cultivating them is found to be from shoots.
In the year 1801, when I belonged to H.M.S. Cambrian, (the Honourable Captain Legge,) on our return voyage from St. Helena, we passed so near this island, that we sent a 24-pound shot among the hills, and saw it scatter the dust around the spot where it fell, but we did not send a boat on shore, for we knew it was then uninhabited, and our Commander was not disposed to lose his time in turning turtle, while he might be more gallantly employed chasing the enemy. We merely fired as a signal to any one that might have been left on the island by accident, for on the preceding year H.M.S. Endymion took on board the crew of a brig that had been wrecked on the island: and the celebrated navigator, Dampier, was also cast away here in the Roebuck, of 12 guns, on his return voyage from New Holland. Little could I have imagined at the time of my first visit, that I should ever have landed here, under my present peculiar circumstances, or that after so many years I should find so much to interest me in a place that presented nothing to my recollection but utter desolation. The alteration in the island was indeed curious, and I am happy to learn, that the improvements still proceed with at least equal energy, and proportionate success. Since my last visit, I am told that, the inhabitants have greatly increased their facilities of obtaining, and preserving supplies of fresh water, an achievement which must necessarily add much to their daily comfort.
Monday, August 4, 1828.&mdash;Our muleteers had no small trouble to collect their animals in readiness for us to start at the appointed time (four in the morning); indeed, they had been full two hours beating about the bush to get them together. Fortunately, however, these men go to rest so early, that they think little of getting up in the middle of the night, to collect and load their mules, which is a common occurrence, as an early start is desirable for both man and beast, because two hours travelling before sunrise, is not half so fatiguing as one hour after it; the muleteers are also glad to promote any measure that will enable them to complete their day's journey before sunset, that they may get their supper and go to rest so soon as it is dark, which, in this tropical region, is always at an early hour. Between nine and ten we arrived at a venda, called Funelle, where we breakfasted on eggs and milk, standing at a counter, there being no other apartments in this small habitation, except the bed-room of a pretty young black-eyed widow, who was laughing and flirting with our party the whole time we remained. Having made but a third of our intended day's journey, we were obliged to tear ourselves away from the interesting widow's fascinations, greatly to the annoyance of some of my companions, who would fain have prolonged the pleasure of her agreeable trifling:&mdash;but
The islands of Mayo, Bonavista (or St. Filippe), and St. Jago, were the first of the Cape de Verds discovered, in May 1461, by Antonio de Nolle, a Genoese in the service of Portugal; and St. Jago, was the first settled. The remaining seven were also discovered the same year, by Portuguese subjects, namely, St. Antonio, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, St. Nicholas, Sall, Fuego, and Bravos.
'Cape Coast Castle, 30th January, 1783.
Champion, cruized off Fernando Po, two days in July last, in order to fall in with a frigate of thirty guns, and a sloop of fourteen, but, being both in the harbour, they would not come out. These two vessels remained in St. Thomas's in October last, where they had carried 200 troops, the only remains of 3000 that had originally been sent to Fernando Po, where the Spaniards had made a settlement, and landed a great quantity of brass cannon, and all kinds of military stores; but the natives were so disgusted with the Spanish Government, that they poisoned the water, which caused a great mortality and obliged the survivors to go away. However, previous to their departure, they dismounted and buried the cannon and all the stores; and, after they were gone, the natives demolished all the fortification, and threw the stones into the sea. A few Portuguese natives of St. Thomas's who for misdemeanors had been sold to the Spaniards by the Portuguese Government, are now remaining in the island ready to shew where the cannon and stores are buried; and, from what Captain Lawson has heard, the natives seem to wish that the English would come and settle among them, promising to render us every assistance in their power in erecting a settlement there. The importance of the trade carried on to Leeward having already been represented to you, I shall not add on the subject.'

n askedabout it by an interviewer, but it has long been assumed that this problem wasaddressed by conducting surveys via paper and pencil questionnaires. However,by comparing paper-and-pencil surveys to those self-administered on a computer,, "the new study shows thats not true. Which means that many accepted", paper-and-pencil surveys have rendered a distorted sense of how people behave.The Science study, for instance, purports to show that among 1,60015-19-year-old males, those computer-queried were almost 4 times more likelythan the paper-and-pencil group to report homosex, 5.5 times more likely toadmit they were often or always drunk or high when having sex with women, and14 times more likely to cop to sex with an intravenous drug user.            In the modern age, and especially in the modern newspaper, the pursuit ofmoney takes on the full aura that was, in a bygone time, reserved for the, "pursuit of something else. Witness todays WSJ front-page account of the Daimler/Chrysler", merger. You have to wade pretty far down to get to "revenues," "earningsper share," or "non-recurring income tax benefits." First you get the secrethotel meetings, the furtive use of code names, the artful deflection of an, "outsiders nosy question about the relationship. Theres even, according to the", Journal , an important shower scene. And of course, there is, once theliaison is on the verge of consummation, the age-old question of whose name totake. "It was a very emotional issue at the end, emotional on both sides,"Daimler\s CEO is quoted saying. "We both felt strongly." But then they merged.And it was good.                                                   The Senate Butts In                           USAHello and the Washington Post lead with the new tobacco settlement billtaking shape in the Senate. The New York Timesleads with the endorsement by House Republican leaders of new tax breaks tohelp people who must buy their own health insurance. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the general split inside Republican ranks over whether, "or not tax cuts should be part of this years budget. The story notes that the", current proposed House budget includes tax cuts totaling [[[[$60 ]billion]]], comparedto the [[$35]0 billion ]worth of cuts called for in the Contract with America.                           USAT reports that the proposed tobacco bill would raise the price ofa pack of cigarettes by [[[[$1]].10 ]and ]would cost cigarette companies more than halfa trillion dollars--a considerable increase over the [$365 billion ]agreed to inthe proposed settlement reached last summer between the attorneys general of 40states and the leading tobacco manufacturers. Like that settlement, the Senatebill aims to reduce underage smoking, regulate nicotine as a drug and alter thetone and reach of tobacco advertising. It also includes a payout to tobaccofarmers as compensation for lost income.            The WP states, "Both the tobacco industry and public health advocatesassailed the bill from opposite directions: The industry called its price-tag, "unrealistic and onerous while public health advocates said it was too weak on", the key issue of cutting underage smoking." Yet, USAT says, "tobaccoindustry spokesmen declined public comment." Also, it\s very odd to talk aboutthe reaction of the "industry" and "public health advocates" so broadly.Neither are monoliths. So, why no for-attribution quotes in the Postaccount here?            The Post does explain one nuance USAT overlooks: whether that[[[$1]].10 ]per pack surcharge specified in the bill will actually raise cigaretteprices enough to significantly reduce cigarette purchases. By the way, theNYT states the Republicans plan to pay for their health insuranceinitiative with revenue raised from higher cigarette taxes, with or without thepassage of a comprehensive tobacco settlement.            The Wall Street Journal presents the "Award for EnvironmentalLunacy" to the Michigan bureaucrat who sent a letter to a landowner lastDecember threatening him with "enforcement action" for "unauthorized" and"hazardous" dam-building on his property. The landowner responded by pointingout that the dams were built by...beavers.            The Journal \s main "Politics and Policy" piece notes asignal consequence of the absorption of the White House staff in the Clintonsex scandals: the further empowerment of his Cabinet officers. Especially true,says the paper, for Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, LawrenceSummers, Budget Director Frank Raines, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,and Defense Secretary William Cohen.            The WP runs a front-page piece noting that the NCAA is very worried about the fallout from the point-shavingindictment last week of two former Northwestern basketball players. The, "amount of money bet legally in Nevada on this years basketball tournament,", says the Post , exceeds the amount bet there on the Super Bowl, and theFBI says close to [$2.5 billion ]is bet on it illegally. Gee, maybe, the, "situation would improve if newspapers didnt print point-spreads.",             Meanwhile, the NYT front is concerned with another, er, sport. TheTimes takes note of the latest developments in professional wrestling:more sexual content, coarser language, and no more Good Guys. This apparentlyproduced an existential crisis on 43rd St.: "Now, there is no obvious moralcenter: everything is basically bad and worse." Thank God, there\s BrendanMaguire, a professor of sociology at Western Illinois University specializingin wrestling, for these troubled Times to quote.            Over the weekend, "Titanic" director James "King of the World" Cameron beganexercising the perks of his new office by writing a piece in the LAT in, "which he tried to fire the papers lead film critic, author of two scathing", reviews of the iceberg epic. "Forget about Clinton," the director wrote, "Howdo we impeach Kenneth Turan?"                                                   Softwar            The two antitrust lawsuits filed against Microsoft by the Justice Departmentand twenty states lead at the New York Times ,LosAngeles Times , and Washington Post . The suits are also flagged at the top ofthe Wall Street Journal front-page news box. They are, "the off-lead at USA Hello (and also covered in that papers front-page", "cover story"), which leads instead with the news that in working out the [[[$20]0]]billion highway bill, congressional negotiators dropped the provision thatwould have set a tough national drunk-driving standard.            The papers all have the same basic lawsuit details: The government and statelawyers argue that after an abortive attempt at an "illegal conspiracy" dealwith browser rival Netscape, Microsoft violated antitrust laws by using itsvirtual lock with Windows to dominate the Internet browser market. AlthoughMicrosoft has already begun shipping Windows 98, the plaintiffs have asked ajudge to issue a quick preliminary injunction requiring the company to either, "take its own browser out of that program or also include Netscapes browser.", And preventing Microsoft from enforcing contracts with online service providersthat would restrict the providers from also offering their customersalternative browsers. (An area, says the NYT , that MS was apparently flexible about beforenegotiations broke down over the weekend.) The state suit additionally asks forMicrosoft to be forced to change the way it sells its "Office" software to, "computer manufacturers so that they would be freer to license competitors", software.            Bill Gates is quoted in the WP saying that these government demandsfor inclusion of competitors is like "requiring Coca-Cola to include three cans of Pepsi in everysix-pack." The NYT lead editorial says the analogy is bad because Coke, "isnt a monopoly.", , "            The governments papers include Microsoft internal e-mails and memos as well", as interviews and depositions of Microsoft executives, which, USAT says,the government attorneys consider smoking-gun evidence. The WP cites forinstance a memo that says it would "be very hard to increase browser share onthe merits" of the company\s product, and hence that the company should"leverage Windows to make people use" it. But none of the dailies explain howthese internal documents came to be possessed by the government nor wonderabout the propriety of that. Also, although the WP and NYT listthe states suing, there is no explanation anywhere about what point there isfor the states to file their own suit, or why the other thirty states arestaying on the sidelines.            Most of the coverage is steeped in the particulars of the memos, etc. TheLAT however, takes a somewhat broader view. It calls themove against Microsoft, "one of the sharpest legal attacks on big business inthis century," and accompanies its lead with an interesting graphic depicting, "the relative market shares enjoyed by American historys other celebrated", "anti-trust targets, IBM, AT&T, and Standard Oil. IBMs is listed at 65", percent, but the other two are the same as Microsoft: 90 percent. TheLAT says that although fewer than half of Americans own a home personalcomputer and fewer still surf the Internet, the suit could throw the computerindustry and the economy into turmoil.            The LAT off-lead reports that three Mexican banks and 107 people wereindicted yesterday in Los Angeles by the U.S. on charges of laundering millionsfor Latin American drug cartels. The story is also on the WP front,while the NYT runs it inside.            The WSJ and the WP report that Kodak is set to announce a deal with AOL designed help thefilm manufacturer counteract inroads on its business being made by computerizedphotography: You bring your film into a Kodak authorized developer and thesnaps are returned digitally to your AOL account. The program will be called"You\ve Got Pictures."            The NYT profile of San Francisco Examiner executive editorPhil Bronstein quotes his wife Sharon Stone thusly: "He\sbig enough for me...for my intense personality, my stature in the world."                                                   These Guns Not For Hire            The New York Times, "leads with President Clintons decision to impose a ban on the import of 58", types of assault-type weapons. This is also the top national story at theLos, "Angeles Times . The Washington Post s top national story is a federally funded", study indicating that a drug previously used to prevent a recurrence of breastcancer could dramatically prevent its onset as well. USA Hello, "leads with the Department of Transportations decision to crack down on", airlines that use unfair methods to snuff out low-fare competitors.            The news about the breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, comes, says, "the WP , from the largest clinical experiment ever for testing a drugs", powers of cancer prevention. However, tamoxifen is also known, says the paper,, "to treble the risk for uterine cancer, and to increase ones chance of", developing blood clots. (The headline over the story at USAT , which runsit as its top-of-the-front-page "talker," emphasizes the "big risk.") It\slikely therefore, that the drug will only be recommended for women at high riskfor breast cancer., "            Clintons gun move, says the NYT and LAT , could keep", more than one million high-powered guns out of the U.S. Assault weapons of thissort have been banned previously, by the Bush administration (1989) and by anearlier Clinton ban (1994), but foreign manufacturers responded by slightlymodifying their weapons. But now, explain the papers, the ATF has ruled thatthese modifications are superficial and hence that the ban sticks. The, "NYT says that the timing of the announcement was driven by Clintons", desire to dramatize government action in the wake of the Arkansas schoolyardshootings, even though none of the types of weapons used there are affected bythe decision. The NRA assailed the ban, and promised to seek relief in Congressand the courts. The LAT says a White House official cites as one reason, "for the move the papers series last year about how weapons companies were", modifying their guns to make them legal but not less lethal. The WPcarries the story inside.            The Wall Street Journal runs a "Rule of Law" feature detailingthe recent trend of the solidification of the rights of dogs, even viciousones. Courts in several states, for instance, have invalidated breed-specificbans because they "deny pit bull lovers equal protection and due process."Plus, Congress is considering "boneheaded" legislation that would force citiesto allow pit bulls in public housing.            A piece in USAT \s "Money" section reports that federal officials areconcerned about the proliferation of companies on the Internet posing as banks.In the past two years, the government has issued ten alerts about suchventures, which could appear to be just like the more than 1,600 legit,chartered banks with web sites., "            Inside the WP theres an AP story stating that according to the", "Department of Justices latest figures, alcohol is a factor in nearly 40", percent of all violent crimes. Victims of spousal abuse report that fullythree-fourths of their attacks were alcohol-related., "            In Sundays column, Maureen Dowd pointed out that when Ken Starr was pressed", "recently to justify the [$30 million ]hes spent so far javerting Bill Clinton,", Starr replied that hey, he always flies coach on his investigatory jaunts toLittle Rock. In the adjacent op-ed, Robert C. Reich reported that first- and, "business class seats now account for more than 22 percent of airlines domestic", "passenger revenue, up from just 9.5 percent in 1987. And according to Sundays", LAT , a dozen California members of Congress routinely use governmentfunds for upgrades to first class or for first-class tickets. The LATdilutes the effect of this story by not mentioning any of the dirty dozen byname until after the jump inside to page 22. The reader has to wait until thetenth paragraph to learn that former Rep. Ronald Dellums routinely booked firstclass seats for his trips, at a cost to taxpayers of six times the basicgovernment rate.            A related story "Hello\s Papers" would love to see: How do the majornewspapers handle this issue? Does, for instance, renowned high-liver Johnny, "Apple of the NYT fly first class when hes on a story and, if so, does", he pay the extra cost or does the Gray Lady go to the hip?                                                   Indonesian: Him Out, "            Everybodys lead is the Suharto resignation. Immediately after Suharto", "announced he was stepping down, Indonesias vice-president, Jusuf Habibie, was", "sworn in as his replacement. The armys commander pledged the loyalty of his", forces to the new leader.            Yet, The Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , and Los AngelesTimes point out that Habibie has not been a favorite of the Indonesianmilitary. But only the WP explains why: He has never served in the armed, "forces and while serving as the governments science and technology minister,", is known to have antagonized some of the top brass by forcing them to makecertain technical purchases.            Reflecting a week in which 500 Indonesians were killed in street riots, inhis announcement Suharto is quoted as saying, "It has become extremelydifficult for me to continue the leadership of this country." Then he employedthe non-apology apology style so favored by discredited Western politicians,expressing his "deepest sorrow if there were any mistakes, failures orshortcomings." But he added something no Western politician says--at least notuntil he\s at his sentencing--he asked his countrymen to "forgive me." OnlyUSA, "Hello s story and headline include this anomaly.",             The New York Times ,, "WP , and LAT go front-page with yesterdays four nearly unanimous", House votes stating that President Clinton failed to act in the nationalinterest earlier this year when he permitted a U.S. company headed up by alarge DNC donor to sell satellite technology to China. Included in the voteswas a measure banning all further satellite exports to China, including currentand pending deals. The NYT and LAT headlines focus on the factsof these restrictions--the WP headline instead goes more for thepolitical angle: "House Rebukes Clinton on China." The LAT mentionsquite clearly, and the WP somewhat obliquely, that then-President Bushalso presided over a waiver of satellite technology to China. The NYTstory does not. But the Times does add something incendiary to the Chinapile: The DOJ blocked the release of a classified Pentagon report holding thatthe satellite help China received under Clinton harmed U.S. national security,, "by upgrading Chinese missile capabilities. The NYT s lead editorial says", "that Newt Gingrichs decision to investigate the export of sensitive technology", to China under the Clinton administration is "right beyond argument.", "            The Post s Howard Kurtz reports that the NYT staff is upset", "over the metro section editors recent remark that it would be unfair for", female journalists who take time off to have children to be as far along intheir careers as men, and that the LAT newsroom is up in arms over the, "publishers claim that women readers are more drawn to emotional stories than", men are, and his proposal of a system that would financially reward senioreditors who ensure stories include more quotations from minority group membersand women.            The LAT op-ed page features a piece by Earl Ofari Hutchinson on therecent trend of banning Kenyans in favor of American competitorsfrom long-distance races, in which Hutchinson wonders if California Gov. PeteWilson and other opponents of affirmative action will protest a policy thatrewards less-qualified white Americans. Well, whether or not they do, it seemsto "Hello\s Papers" that outrage such as Hutchinson\s over the road race policytends to support outrage over affirmative action. Letting slower white American, "runners into races just because theyre white Americans is precisely analogous", to letting blacks and Latinos with poor SATs and low grades into colleges just, "because theyre blacks or Latinos.", , "            The catastrophic breakdown of the nations paging system and the panic it", has inspired draws both news and feature coverage all around. But leave it to abrilliant unnamed NYT editorialist to notice that panic was exactly thewrong way to go. The wise course, he (or she) says, would have been to spendyesterday at the ballpark. Yesterday, was, if we\d only noticed, "a snow day from outer space."            Privacy enthusiast William Safire uses his column today to state his, "positions on some recent eavesdroppings in the news. Linda Tripps taping of", Monica Lewinsky was, he says, not okay, because the intern had a reasonableexpectation of privacy. But the prison tapes of Web Hubbell were okay becausehe did not. Safire dismisses the exculpatory remarks by Hubbell concerningHillary\s innocence, etc. as what FBI parlance calls "tickling thewire"--producing self-serving statements because you know you are beingoverheard. Surprisingly, Safire did not explain how this works by providing the, "most famous example of the tactic: Nixons knowingly taped Oval Office", statement that yes, he could raise money to silence the Watergate burglars,"but it would be wrong."                                                   High Wiring Act            The New York Times, "leads with the recommendation by the nations air safety board that thousands", of airliners currently in service be rewired as a precaution against the sortof fuel tank explosion that destroyed TWA Flight 800. The Washington Post goes with an exclusive about the status and, "contents of Kenneth Starrs impending report to Congress. USA Hello", "leads with President Clintons determination, expressed at a forum on Social", Security, to fix the system. This is also the top national story at theLosAngeles Times .            The rewiring recommendation from the National Transportation SafetyBoard, accompanied by the further suggestion that surge suppressors be put onwires going into fuel tanks, shows, says the NYT , how far investigatorshave come in their understanding of the TWA crash. But, explains the paper, theboard has an advisory role only, and implementation must be carried out by theFAA, which often rebuffs the NTSB. The dramatic extent of the development is, "pointed out by the NYT s observation that Boeing alone has produced", nearly 10,000 airliners currently in service, and that the recommendationapplies to the planes of at least one other company, Airbus, as well.USAT , the LAT , the WP and the Wall Street Journal mention in their accounts that animmediate motive for the advisory was not just the wiring set-up of Flight 800,but also the unsafe ones observed in three retired 747s.                           Post reporter Susan Schmidt obviously had help from someone in, "Starrs office in putting together what amounts to a leaked status report on the fruits of his investigation.", She writes that much of the Starr report earmarked for the House ofRepresentatives (on the grounds that it describes potentially impeachableoffenses) has already been written, and that it pertains not only to President, "Clintons actions in the Lewinsky matter but also may include material about", whether Clinton was truthful in his sworn testimony for the 1996 bank fraudtrial of James and Susan McDougal. The Post also asserts that when theLewinsky case broke, Starr was on the verge of bringing new charges againstClinton crony Webster Hubbell for receiving Whitewater hush money.            Incidentally, notes the WSJ , although in his present role Starr has, "fought hard against the administrations contention that executive privilege", shields some key Clinton advisors as well as Hillary, as a U.S. appeals courtjudge, Starr "seldom rebuffed an assertion of privilege." Indeed, he wrote or, "joined several opinions sending support to Clintons position.",             President Clinton made a no-new-payroll-taxes comment at the first of fourscheduled regional town-hall style meetings on Social Security, in Kansas City.However, reports USAT , aides later said he might support raising morerevenue for the program by increasing the limit on wages subject to the payrolltax. But the NYT says Clinton would be "reluctant" to do that.USAT says that one of the few concrete positions Clinton took at themeeting was ruling out a conversion of Social Security to a private pensionsystem. But the NYT says Clinton is willing to consider private, "individual accounts provided the overall plan theyre a part of continues to", provide recipients with a guaranteed retirement benefit. The LAT , in itsfront-page piece, agrees that Clinton sees the possibility of someprivatization., "            The WP has Clinton advisor Paul Begalas reaction to House Majority", "Leader Dick Armeys comment that if he were facing the same sexual misconduct", charges as Clinton, he would resign: "If goofy ideas ever go up to [$40 ]abarrel, I\d like to have the drilling rights to Dick Armey\s head."                                                   America Discovers Columbus            The LosAngeles Times , Washington Post , and New York Timesall lead with the raucous reception the top Clinton foreign policy figures weresurprised to receive when they appeared at a town-hall-style discussion of Iraqin Columbus, Ohio. USA Hello , which runs Columbus as its off-lead, goes with, "Ken Starrs questioning of President Clintons key advisor, Bruce Lindsey.", "USAT says Lindseys five-hour grand jury appearance Wednesday included", testimony about past telephone conversations with Linda Tripp. The questioningapparently set off a special conference with a judge about whether or not aideslike Lindsey are protected by executive privilege, although USAT saysthat the White House has not invoked it.            The in-studio Columbus audience of about 6,000 served up what the LATcalls a "raucous, emotional debate that showed a nation far from convinced ofthe administration\s course in the Persian Gulf." Or as the WP puts it,the Clinton team of William Cohen, Madeleine Albright, and Sandy Berger camefor a seminar, but "ran into a rumble." The Post reports that duringcommercial breaks, while the startled Clintonites held whispered conferences,aides fanned out into the noisy parts of the arena to calm those (numberingabout 200, guesses the Times ) chanting "We don\t want your racist war."Some of the most aggressive hecklers were carried outside.            The Post serves up an acute description of what transpired: theadministration reps found themselves caught between opposing passions (aboutbeing two tough on Iraq, about not being tough enough) armed only with alargely passionless argument. The paper notes a simple example of thepredicament: Cohen waved about a photo of a mother and infant killed by Iraqichemical warfare while arguing against deposing or killing Hussein.            The juxtaposition on the Post top-front is striking: "Top Aidesshouted down at \Town Meeting\ on Iraq" cheek-by-jowl with "The Guys arePumped," over a story about the stealth fighter crews massing in Kuwait.            The pieces make it clear that the ordinary folks in the auditorium werehighly attuned to an issue that has gotten hardly any attention in the press:consistency. In other words, why should we punish Hussein and support andreward say, Indonesia, which has been slaughtering people in East Timor?            But the coverage barely notices that the Columbus protest suggests somethingsquishy or downright wrong in all those polls showing extensive public support, "for President Clintons stance. (And probably puts the kibosh on that planned", town hall meeting on presidential dating.)            The WP front reports that a rising number of women poor enough to beon Medicaid would like to be sterilized, but because of their own paperwork, "errors and stiff bureaucratic requirements, they arent and keep having kids.", An additional factor is that the doctors who deliver these babies are scared ofbeing sued by women still in their child-bearing years. Also, Medicaid rulesprohibit the sterilization of a woman under 21 no matter how many children shehas., "            The WP notes a media consequence of laffaire Lewinsky: a rebound for", "conservatively oriented talk radio. This doesnt just mean, notes the", Post , better numbers for Rush and the G-man, but also things like Monicalook-alike contests and two stations offering million dollar prizes to anywoman who can prove she slept with the president.            Both the Wall Street Journal and the NYT report that most of, "the nations law schools attacked the upcoming U.S. News and World", Report rankings (due out Friday). The schools hired a consultant to rebutthe listings and sent out a letter debunking them to 93,000 current law-schoolapplicants., "            Opponents of affirmative action often observe that it doesnt exist in", "performance-based arenas like show business. But a small item in the WP s TV column makes you wonder", even about that: It seems that UPN has ordered up a full season of episodes forthe virtually all-black "Moesha," which as of last Sunday, the paper reports,ranked 124th among the 139 series on the air.                                                   B-2 Or Not B-2?            Everybody leads with that case-against-Iraq speech President Clinton gave atthe Pentagon yesterday. Speaking to an auditorium full of military and civilianDefense employees, and from a platform he shared with his Secretary of Defenseand his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Clinton justified possible airstrikeswith an implicit reference to the failures of appeasement in the period justbefore World War II. "Force can never be the first answer," said Clinton. "Butsometimes, it\s the only answer."            In its piece on the speech, USA Hello mentions that the Secretary-General of theU.N., Kofi Annan, is going to Baghdad to try for a peaceful resolution. The, "Washington Post makes it clear that if Annans", mission fails to produce Iraqi compliance, an air bombardment is a "virtualcertainty." The administration\s old line was, says the paper, "weeks notmonths," but its new one is "days not weeks."            Both the WP and the New York Timesnote that Clinton has defined down his military objective--now we are after,not totally ridding Iraq of mass destruction weapons, but seriously diminishingtheir threat. However, Clinton did not, notes the Times , explain at whatpoint he would consider the Iraqi threat seriously diminished., "            The Times  James Bennet obviously got to somebody present at the", military briefing Clinton attended just before speaking. His report revealsthat the briefing ran 45 minutes and centered on the details of a militarystrike. Clinton mostly listened and made no new decisions. But he did ask aboutthe potential casualties in a strike, both among Iraqi civilians and American, "pilots. He also asked about Iraqs ability to use chemical and biological", weapons in a confrontation., "            Both the WP and the NYT mention President Clintons dismissal", of Saddam\s desire to exempt certain "presidential" sites from weaponsinspection. One such site, Clinton explained, is 40,000 acres, whereas theWhite House grounds take up but 18. The Times includes this quote of the president\s: "We\re not talking about a few roomshere with delicate personal matters involved." In the age of Lewinsky, you, "dont have to be Freud to find that an interesting choice of words for what", goes on in the White House.            The LosAngeles Times wisely puts at the top of its lead the simplest, mostforceful argument Clinton made, one that both USAT and WP omittedand the NYT postponed until the last paragraphs of its story: His"guarantee" that if Hussein isn\t stopped now, he will someday use hisbiochemical weapons.            The USAT , WP , and LAT fronts all report President, "Clintons lawyers asked the judge in the Paula Jones case to dismiss her suit", "for lack of substance. The WP runs the text of Clintons legal motion in the matter, which includes an", argument that strikes the lay person as bizarrely permissive: Even on theassumption that then-Gov. Clinton undertook the actions towards Paula Jones inthe Excelsior Hotel room that Jones alleges, that would not constitute "hostileenvironment sexual harassment" because Jones went to the room voluntarily, theepisode only lasted at most 20 minutes, there was no violence or explicitthreats and she was able to leave when she decided to.            The NYT front marshals the factors behind that ski lift disaster inItaly two weeks ago: on his first flight in the area, the Marine Corps pilotdid not have maps showing the ski lift, was violating orders to fly 1,000 abovethe ground and was off-course. All this beneath a headline that is simplyextraordinary in this age of lawyers restraining editors restraining reporters:"HOW WAYWARD US PILOT KILLED 20 ON SKI LIFT."            "I know it\s not the most traditional way to balance the budget, but it justmight work." According to the Wall Street Journal "Tax Report," some 3,000 taxpayersrecently received notices from the IRS informing them that they each owed theagency [$300,000],000.            At the Pentagon, real-world combat requirements come first--except when they, "dont. A WP front-page piece reveals that even though the B2 stealth bomber is the most expensive aircraft ever built", ([$2 billion ]a copy), and could drop large numbers of "bunker buster" bombs on, "Iraq without ever setting foot on skittish Arab runways, its not likely to see", action over Iraq. The Pentagon corridor explanation teased out by the WPis that if it were to fail it would be a colossal embarrassment for the AirForce, while if it were to succeed it might siphon money away from newer hotAir Force aircraft programs.                                                   As the World Interns            The initial phase of the Clinton counter-thrust, which hit the beach on theSunday chat shows, leads everywhere. The main theme is not defend Clinton somuch as attack Starr. The TV appearances of James Carville and Paul Begala arenoted all around, as is the return to the White House of Harold Ickes, MickeyKantor, and Harry Thomasson (filming "A Place Called Hopeless?"). Everybody, "also reports that negotiations between Ken Starr and Monica L.s lawyer", continue.                           USAHello reports that the strategy includes Clinton issuing a fresh denialat 10 AM (ET) this morning at an event focusing on his child care proposals.The Washington Post says this move was still up fordebate as it went to press.                           USAT and the Wall Street Journal state that ABC News reports thatClinton and Lewinsky were seen "in an intimate encounter" in the White House in1996. The front-page of the Los Angeles Times has this too, but with no mentionof ABC as the source.            The WP lead reveals that Clinton has directed his pollsters to findout how much the scandal has affected his standing with the public. TheNew York Timessays an internal poll has already shown a drop of 15 percentage points.Independent polls mentioned in the dailies also indicate slippage. ThePost paints a backstage picture in which anxious aides fear that thepresident is not widely believed. And, the paper says, several administrationofficials and Democrat operatives privately say they are worried that Clintonmay not be telling the truth. Some Democratic congressional staff members tell, "the Post that Clintons plan to omit all mention of the controversy from", the State of the Union speech is "totally surreal."            The NYT lead is accompanied by a large picture of Bill and Hillarycoming out of church yesterday morning sharing a big ole laugh with theminister. (They must have really enjoyed the sermon, "The Eight Commandments.")The Times notes that in their public remarks Sunday, the pro-Clintoniteswere careful not to attack Lewinsky. "We don\t want to push her into Starr\sarms," is the explanation. The paper also states that Clinton loyalists are"greatly distressed," and mentions that William Cohen recently looked unusuallydepressed and shaken. Cohen is quoted as saying in a private meeting that ifthe accusations are true, "it\s all over."            Another case of staff distress is reported by the WSJ , which recountshow, at a public forum in D.C., Clinton health-care adviser Chris Jenningsbroke down in tears in the middle of a speech.            The Journal editorial "Bonfire of the Presidency" counters the suggestion comingfrom some quarters that Monica L. has an overactive imagination with thequestion, "Did a delusional 24-year-old make up the point about perjury notoften being prosecuted in civil cases?" The Journal finds all thepsychopathology in the case elsewhere: ".[T]he roots of this crisis lie, "somewhere in the psyche shaped by Mr. Clintons genes, troubled childhood and", life experiences.", "            The story of the Popes departure from Cuba after a five-day stay makes everybodys", front.

But the pontiff also criticized Cuban atheism and called for the, "protection of all Cubans rights.",             The NYT reports that a new study from the CDC shows a continuing, and in some ways,growing disparity between the health of blacks and whites. Some examples: Thenumber of diabetes cases rose 33 percent among blacks, three times the increaseamong whites. Ditto for infectious diseases. And from 1987 to 1995, the deathrate for black mothers in childbirth jumped 48 percent, compared with anoverall rate of 7.6 percent. And blacks still have two times the infantmortality rare of whites., "            In light of the decision by Sonny Bonos widow to run for his congressional", seat, the LAT front page reports that among first-time House candidatesfrom 1916 to 1993, 84 percent of the widows won, while only 14 percent of theother women did.            The NYT runs an op-ed by writer JannaMalamud Smith that states "If we\re going to make simplistic rules abouttruth-telling, mine would start here: Ms. Tripp should have told Ms. Lewinskywhy she invited her to lunch.. " Elsewhere on the page, Anthony, "Lewis makes a point in passing thats been overlooked thus far: Ken Starr", first got Ms. Tripp to wear a wire and then used its fruits to get permission, "to widen his investigation. Shouldnt the permission to widen have", preceded the wire, which was in fact the widening?

And the Post emphasizes that how muchof the collateral sexual material gets into the actual trial is up to the trialjudge. The paper clearly has a Jones Jones, also reporting that she emergedfrom Saturday\s deposition "clearly elated," dining out, drinking champagne andlaughing, and putting a second Paula piece on the front, about how the publicis taking the whole thing.

(The NYT has a big picture on the front of ablack church choir, but puts its King story, about how Memphis handles his, "memory, inside.) One is that Al Gore will announce today, at Kings church in", Atlanta, a 17 percent DOJ budget increase that if approved by Congress wouldmean a stepped-up anti-discrimination emphasis in such areas as fair-housinglaws and police misconduct investigations. The other is the bizarre news thatlast week, the family of one of the young girls murdered in that 1963Birmingham church bombing discovered that her grave is empty.            Iraq has largely slipped off the front page, but the USAT off-lead describeshow both sides are talking tougher now. Sen. John McCain, reports the paper,called on TV over the weekend for "sustained air operations" if the crisis, "isnt resolved, while the Iraqi VP urged 1 million Iraqis to join a new", military force to stage a holy war against the U.N. sanctions. (Suggestedslogan: "We do more surrendering before 9 o\clock than most soldiers do allday.")            The NYT observes that last year, there were [[[$1]] ]trillion worth ofmergers involving U.S. companies, 50 percent more than 1996, which was itself arecord year. The paper likens these mega-mergers to the industrial upheavals atthe beginning of the twentieth century, when more than a dozen auto companiesbecame General Motors and dozens of steel companies were forged by J.P. Morganinto U.S. Steel.            Inside, the Times reports that a former American ambassador toBritain has, in a new book excerpted in the Sunday Telegraph , chargedthat the U.S. ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, is such an "ardent IRAapologist" that the British began withholding sensitive security informationfrom the Clinton White House., "            According to the WP , Chinas main English language paper announced", that Chinese military factories had [[$7 billion] ]in export sales last year.

USAT and the WP lead with the heating-up Paula Jonescase. The NYT national edition goes with the maneuvering between Castro and the, "Catholic Church on the eve of the Popes visit to Cuba. The LAT leads with the", likely stance President Clinton will take in separate White House meetings thisweek with Netanyahu and Arafat--gentle persuasion, not tough talk.

The New York Times, "goes with the Senates defeat of a proposal for limiting the cost to the U.S.", of expanding NATO.            The UN dues bill includes a rider barring U.S. aid to international familyplanning groups that perform or support abortions, which, says the LAT ,"almost certainly dooms" the payback effort. The LAT and WP note that both Trent Lott and Jesse Helms say aveto means there will be no further action on this. USAT and theWP remind readers that House Republicans attached a similar poison pillprovision to the last attempt at a UN pay-up, which was vetoed by PresidentClinton., "            The coverage plays into Washingtons unfortunate preference for politics", "over substance: there isnt a word about those international family planning", organizations (none are even identified) and to what extent they facilitateabortions.            The NYT reports that the Senate discussion concerning NATO continues to be lively, and thatthe cost cap was the first of perhaps two dozen NATO expansion amendments the, "Senate will consider before its through. Yesterdays debate focused mainly on", whether or not the proposed new members--Poland, Hungary, and the CzechRepublic--can afford to field the level of armed forces NATO requires. TheTimes notes that expansion cost issues seem paramount to the Senate., "This means many members dont really trust the official estimates, because", officially, expansion will cost but [$40 ]million a year over the nextdecade--less than half a new fighter plane a year.            And the Times explains that some senators are concerned that more and, "more new members will be coming in, hurting NATOs strength. It occurs to", "Hello\s Papers" though, that here may lie the true solution: Let any countryjoin NATO. If members are required to promise not to attack each other, as the, "number of non-member countries declines, the alliances military needs would", diminish and hence so would its expenses.            Economic factoids: the LAT and USAT fronts report that thebooming economy has delayed the insolvency of Social Security for threeadditional years--until 2032. The WP runs this on the inside, butreports on its front that the Y2K problem will cost U.S. companies [$50 billion]and worldwide, the cost to business will be [$300 billion].            Just days ago, the new warm and fuzzy Newt Gingrich was on tour with a bookmostly about diet and exercise. Well, judging from the WP second lead,book sales must have slipped and Newt is back on red meat. The paper quotes, "Gingrichs assessment of the Clinton administration as", engaged in "the most systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice cover-up andeffort to avoid the truth we have ever seen in American history, and the time, "has come to say to the president, Quit undermining the law in the United", States. Turn over the evidence.\"            Last fall, an LAT front-page spread made IRS abuses a big story. Thepaper stays on the case with a front-page account of a Senate hearing Tuesdaythat disclosed corruption among IRS officials: one was thought to have stolenas many as twenty confiscated luxury vehicles and another wrote an anonymousthreatening letter to a tax attorney who had testified against the agency atcongressional hearings. The WP runs the tax hearings inside. TheWall Street Journal "Tax Report" reports that JackRegan Stevens, a former IRS officer, pleaded guilty to embezzling 13 taxpayerpayments totaling more than [$77,000 ]by altering payment checks made out to"IRS" so that they resembled his initials. The column also includes a modestproposal for ushering in a simplified tax code: require all members of Congressand the president to prepare their own returns without professional help.            Why is demi-billionaire California gubernatorial candidate Al Checchi aDemocrat? Because, he is quoted on the LAT op-ed page, "It\s easier toteach economics to Democrats than compassion to Republicans."            "Hello\s Papers" is more than a little mystified by the sudden journalisticinterest in the reality of the Jerry Springer show. Pretty soon, the paperswill be breathlessly revealing that talk-show couch conversations are scriptedand that Sam Donaldson employs fake hair and real researchers. Still, the idea, "in a letter to todays Times from a Yale med school prof", is a good one: just put a cop on the Springer set. Real fights would meet with, "arrests and fake ones wouldnt and hence would be quickly unmasked. Either way,", says the doc, the audience would evaporate.                                                   Bad Tripp, "            The State of the Union speech is everybodys lead. President Clintons", desire to use any budget surpluses to "Save Social Security First" generally, "leads the lists of the speechs proposals, which included calls to raise the", minimum wage, expand Medicare and child-care subsidies, as well as [$7 billion]to recruit 100,000 new teachers, a "patient bill of rights" for managed-careclients, and funding for the IMF. Clinton also used the occasion to warn( USAHello says "threaten") Saddam Hussein that the U.S. is determined todeny him the ability to use weapons of mass destruction again.            The Washington Post calls the SOTU an "activist agenda" that isthe "most expensive and comprehensive" that Clinton has put forward since theRepublicans captured control of Congress in 1994. The New York Timesobserves that this sweeping program comes two years after Clinton declared the, "end of the era of big government, but goes on to note Clintons alternative", description: "We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation." TheWall Street Journal SOTU piece provides a usefulclarification here: "While federal spending has declined as a share of thetotal economy, the drop has come mostly in defense spending. Meanwhile, socialspending has grown relative to the gross domestic product, particularly for theentitlement programs....."            Noting the scandal context, the Los AngelesTimes calls last night "awkward and electrifying," while the NYTdeclares, "Few other politicians of his generation--or any other--could havepulled off a performance like that of Clinton on Tuesday night." (The paperalso passes along word that earlier in the day Clinton was nominated for theNobel Peace Prize. Hmmmm..that might be what it takes.)            The NYT runs a separate front-page piece about the Iraq situation that notes the increasing tempo ofAmerican-British strike planning. The piece also reports that the U.S. hopes toget support from Saudia Arabia for any action against Iraq, in the form of, "permission to use the countrys air bases.", , "            Theres a lot of front-page coverage of Hillary Clintons remarks yesterday", on the "Hello" show, in which she described Kenneth Starr as a "politicallymotivated prosecutor" who is part of "a vast right-wing conspiracy." Severaldailies report that Starr dismissed her comments as "nonsense." And USATstates that Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a Starr ally, responded by calling Mrs.Clinton a ""frustrated woman.lashing out without foundation.", "            The LAT runs a front-page piece reporting on the appearance yesterday before Starrs grand jury by Clintons", personal secretary, Betty Currie. Prosecutors are interested in a series ofvisits--approved by Currie--Monica L. made to the White House when the formerintern no longer worked there. They are also, says the paper, trying todetermine whether Currie tried to make contact with Lewinsky from the White, "House on the day Lewinsky was first interrogated by Starrs FBI agents.", , "            The WP reports that Monicas lawyers and Ken Starr are moving closer", to some sort of deal under which she would testify about whether she had asexual relationship with the president as well as--and this would be a big chipfor Starr--whether Clinton urged her to deny this Date of the Union. ThePost also says that more than a year prior to secretly taping MonicaLewinsky, Linda Tripp tried to sell a book about the Clinton White House,asking the conservative publisher Alfred Regnery for something in theneighborhood of [$500,000]. Her agent? Lucianne Goldberg. The working title ofthe four-page proposal was, "Behind Closed Doors: What I Saw Inside the ClintonWhite House." One chapter was titled, "The President\s Women.", "            Looking for a college campus that actually doesnt have enough", political correctness? Check out the University of Florida. There, reports the, "WP , the universitys white president, John Lombardi got to keep his job", after he described his boss, Chancellor Adam Herbert, who is black, as an"Oreo." Legislators and powerful alumni came to Lombardi\s defense.            Media predictions: At one time feared to be old hat, "Primary Colors" shouldnow do big box office. And theround-the-clock-more-lawyers-turned-commentators-than-is-compatible-with-healthy-digestion coverage of the upcoming Paula Jones trialshould reach O.J. proportions.            If you thought that Dick Morris, now back in Bill Clinton\s "crisiscabinet," was going to make things smoother at the White House, you don\t know, "Dick. Maureen Dowd quotes the recovering toe suckers explanation for why the", president might have a wandering eye: ".Let\s assume, O.K., that his sexual, "relationship with Hillary is not all its supposed to be, lets assume that", some of the allegations that Hillary--sometimes not necessarily being intoregular sex with men--might be true."                                                   Criminal Types!                           USAHello , the Washington Post , and the New York Times, "each lead with a federal judges rejection of Monica Lewinskys claim that she", had an immunity deal with Ken Starr. The Los AngelesTimes leads with the results of the first U.S. study of the Frenchabortion pill RU-486: highly effective and safe for terminating early, "pregnancies, a story that doesnt make the other front pages (the NYT", national edition carries it on p. 20)., "            Lewinskys lawyers had been arguing that a letter from Starr granted her", "immunity. The judges dismissal of that contention, writes USAT , may set", the stage for Starr to force Lewinsky to "appear" before a federal grand jury.This is a little confusing since actually, Starr would have had more leverageto force Lewinsky to testify (rather than just show up) if she hadimmunity from prosecution. (The WP and NYT get this point right.), "But in any case, one of Lewinskys lawyers, William Ginsburg, is quoted by", USAT as saying his client "will never testify before a grand jurywithout immunity." And the Post reports that her other lawyer, NathanielSpeights, "ridiculed" the idea that Starr would indict his client. "No one," heis quoted as saying, "is going to stand for somebody being indicted for havinga sexual relationship with the president." (Hello\s reports in the NYTand WP to the effect that Hillary Clinton used the maritalconfidentiality privilege to avoid answering some Starr questions means that, "she may be somebody who is not being indicted because shes having a", sexual relationship with the president.), "            The judges ruling is still under seal. USAT credits the story to an", unnamed "person with knowledge of the decision." The Post cites"individuals familiar with the case." The LAT refers to "sources closeto either side of the investigation." Wonder why the NYT semi-outed itsown sources, saying they are "lawyers," which leaves them quite vulnerable topunishment by the judge, who warned the lawyers in the case against disclosingher sealed rulings.            The LAT front and the insides of the Wall Street Journal and the WP report that aconsortium of Blue Cross health plans in 38 states (why does the WSJ inits story use the odd locution "more than 35 states"?) filed lawsuits againstthe tobacco industry, seeking billions in damages to compensate for the expenseof treating smoking-related illnesses. The lawsuits, modeled on thosesuccessfully brought by several state governments in recent years, constitute,in the words of the LAT , a "major new assault" in what is already, "historys costliest collection of cases. A similar ratcheting up is afoot in", the Microsoft wars, with, the NYT front reports, thirteen statesplanning a joint antitrust action, separate from the pending federal caseagainst the company, to block the release of Windows 98.            The NYT has a front-page exclusive detailing a first in the annals ofcrime: a cyber murder confession. On March 22, a man screen-named "Larry"made a posting to an on-line alcoholics support group in which he described howthree years ago he murdered his five-year-old daughter. The on-line chat thatfollowed included postings comforting the man by telling him that the crime waslong past, but three of the people participating went to authorities, and a fewdays later, in a phone call to police in North Dakota, where the crimeoccurred, Larry Froistad confessed again.            As William Safire did earlier in the week, the NYT lead editorial has, "harsh words for the Justice Departments investigation into the 1996 Clinton", "re-election efforts possible illegal use of campaign funds. The editorial,", titled "Janet Reno\s Latest Trick," says the departure of the lead prosecutorafter only seven months makes it "plain that his appointment was apublic-relations masquerade." Reno had to approve his transfer to a U.S., "Attorneys job in San Diego and so has, says the paper, once again", "snookered...citizens who wanted a full investigation of the most corruptcampaign fund-raising operation since Watergate.", "            The WP s T.R. Reid tells of the latest O.J. outrages. It seems that when a BBC reporter", knocked on his door recently, he came out pretending to stab her several timeswith a banana. In the subsequent interview with her, Simpson said that gorgeouswomen are constantly throwing themselves at him. When Simpson spotted an L.A.District Attorney on the street while riding around in a BBC van, he respondedthe same way any other innocent citizen would: he leaned out of the window andshouted "an anatomical obscenity" at her. (By the way, why the code phrase? Ifthe Post can--unlike the NYT --let its readers know when acongressman thinks the president is a "scumbag," then surely it can come dirtyon this little bit of verbiage.)                                                   Willey or Willie?                           USAHello and the Washington Post lead with Kathleen Willey\s "60 Minutes"interview. The other papers pretend there was something else on. The Los Angeles, "Times says the days top story is the government of Irans crackdown on", oil shipments to Iraq that violate U.N. sanctions. The New York Times ,even more transparent in its attempt to appear above pack journalism, goeswith--are you sitting down?--the possibility that Republicans could take over, "all the governors slots of the old Confederacy. This is particularly odd in", that the NYT \s own front-page Willey story states that "even the, "presidents supporters say that if proved true, the accusations of perjury and", "obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter could end Clintons", presidency."            In her interview, Willey gave a paw-by-paw description of her encounter withPresident Clinton in a small study off the Oval Office and charged that Clinton, "lied about it. All the papers have Willeys comment that she considered", slapping him but decided not to because "I don\t think you can slap thepresident of the United States.." And everybody has Clinton lawyer RobertBennett\s comment that his client is "absolutely bewildered" by Willey\sallegations, and that there is as yet unreleased information that will undercutthem.                           USAT reports that "Willey also said during the 60 Minutes interviewthat she told Linda Tripp about her encounter in the Oval Office. Willey said, "Tripp, whose tape recording of conversations with Lewinsky sparked Starrs", "investigation, later told her, Im going to get you, and . . . everyone else", in this place before this is all over.\" (Tripp\s lawyers deny that she ever, "made such a statement.) This passage leaves the reader wondering why Tripps", "response to Willeys report of her Oval Office incident would be anger towards", Willey. But what\s really going on is that the paper has garbled the "60Minutes" interview. In it, Willey says that Tripp was angry at her, not aboutthe alleged grope, but because Willey got a White House job--which Tripp, "attributed to Clintons interest in Willey while Tripp lost hers,.",             In its lead, the WP gets this right. The Post also points outthat in some ways, Willey could be a more troublesome witness for Clinton thanthe other women alleging sexual harassment, because Willey was originallyunwilling to tell her story, her accusation is of a non-consensual act, and sheis hardly a Clinton-hating member of the vast right-wing conspiracy HillaryClinton cited, having worked to get Clinton elected.                           USAT quotes the president of NOW, Patricia Ireland, as saying, "It\snot just sexual harassment. If it\s true, it\s sexual assault." The WP, "has this too, but in addition notes the significance of the remark: its a", break with the generally complacent attitude most feminists have maintainedtoward the Clinton sex scandals. (Up till now their motto has been: "The devilyou know is better than...Trent Lott.") Also, USAT decides to leave outthe rest of the Ireland quote, which the WP includes: "He put his handon her breast; he put her hand on his erection. That is a pretty serious chargeif true and it is a very big problem." The NYT , in its front page story, "also makes the point about the significance of Irelands remark, but cuts her", quote just where USAT does. The LAT goes the other way a littlebit, saying that Willey claims Clinton "fondled" her breasts and placed herhand on his "crotch," even though Willey didn\t use either of the words inquotes.            In a wise departure from standard newspaper practice, the Post, "doesnt clean up Willeys quotes, so that its report communicates a good deal", of the emotion of the televised interview: "And then he, then he, then hekissed me on, on my mouth and, and pulled me closer to him. And I remember, "thinking, I just remember thinking, What in the world is he doing? ... And I,", "I pushed back away from him and--he, he, he, he, hes a big man. And he, he had", his arms, they were tight around me and he, he touched me....He touched mybreasts with his hand and I, I, I, I was, I, I was just startled."            There is a dangling thread from the interview that none of the papers tugsat: Willey says that one of the first people she saw after she got away from, "the president was then-Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen. Why doesnt", "some enterprising reporter go ask Bentsen what his impression of Willeys", demeanor was?, "            The LAT s Willey story says that in Clintons Jones case deposition,", he "acknowledged embracing Willey and perhaps kissing her on the forehead. He, "said he has engaged in similar displays of affection with scores and scores of", men and women who have worked for me or been my friends over the years.\" Maybe, "its time some of those men Bill Clinton has kissed on the forehead came", forward to support their president.                                                   Oregon Crazy, "            A fifteen-year-olds shooting spree at his Oregon high school leads USA Hello .

The details of the Oregon shootings are, in the words of the WP ,"disturbingly familiar": a kid well-known for trouble acts out prior threatsvia his access to tremendous firepower. According to the dailies, the boy,Kipland Kinkel, shot up the school cafeteria with a rifle and two pistols,killing one student and wounding twenty-six. The carnage was stopped when acritically wounded student tackled Kinkel. USAT , WP and, "LAT report that two bodies, believed to be that of Kinkels parents,", "were later found in his house. The NYT reached the boys grandmother,", who said that he "murdered his mother and father."            Afterwards, some parents charged that the school had ample warning thatKinkel posed a danger to others. The day before yesterday, he had beensuspended from school and arrested for bringing a gun to school, and he wasreleased to his parents. And he had, the papers say, frequently written andtalked about killing in school assignments. USAT reports that he hadbeen voted by classmates "most likely to start World War III.\\, "            Both the NYT and WP quote an experts observation that the recent", trend of school shootings has accelerated from single specific victims toindiscriminate multiple homicides.            The LAT is the only paper putting merger over murder today. Its account of, "Seagram/Polygram seems a bit breathless. The deal, says the papers lead", paragraph, involves the likes of Hanson, LL Cool J, Van Morrison, and LucianoPavarotti. And it would "radically alter the nature of the architecture of thebusiness by shrinking the number of global competitors from"--can you standit?--"six to five."            Deep inside the WP is a report that casts an interesting light on the, "recent U.N. inspection wrangle with Iraq. The papers Nora Boustany states that", contrary to the general media coverage, back in February when inspectors were, "barred from one of Saddam Husseins presidential palaces, they werent looking", for actual weapons or other hardware--they were looking for documentsabout such things. Which would explain how the Iraqis were able to render thesites pristine in the relatively short time before the inspectors finallygained access.                           USAT achieves a Post-Monica rarity: a half-hour of face-time withPresident Clinton. The president tells the paper he "absolutely" will travel asplanned to China despite GOP criticisms that U.S. policy has been undulyinfluenced by Chinese campaign contributions. Clinton describes his, "administrations decision to allow high technology to be exported to China as", "routine." He also tells USAT that during his trip, he will raise the, "issue of illegal campaign contributions with Chinas leaders. (Thats what", "were afraid of.)",             The Wall Street Journal \s "Washington Wire" reports that sometwenty lawmakers who voted this week to restrict satellite exports to China hadpreviously urged Clinton to export satellites there.

The systems contain unclassifiedbut sensitive information such as the travel schedules of U.S. embassyofficials. The Los Angeles Times goes with the first joint appearance ofthe leading Democratic gubernatorial candidates at a state partyconvention.            The oil news is that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico, which together, "supply about a fifth of the worlds oil, issued a joint statement saying that", they and other oil producers plan a cutback amounting to about 2.7 percent ofworld production. The move, which the WP calls "unusual solidarity," isexpected to send oil prices up. The NYT reports that the initialreaction in the Asian markets on Monday was nearly a [$4 ]up-tick.            The Times explains that having non-OPEC countries like Mexico onboard is important because in the past OPEC production cuts have often been metwith non-OPEC production surges. The paper also notes that many analysts hadbeen predicting the economic pain of low oil revenues would force the producersto rein in production. Clear enough, but then the paper goes on to "illustrate"that idea with the following passage from the joint statement, which isanything but: ".[A] drop in oil prices could lead to a reduction in theinvestments needed to secure international supplies, which would destabilizethe world economy in the medium term."            OSCAR NOTE I: The LAT says that "The Full Monty," made for a paltry[$3.5 million], could ultimately turn a profit of around [[[[$1]]00] million]. TheWall Street Journal says the movie has already rakedin more than [[[$20]0]] million., "            OSCAR NOTE II: This past Saturdays NYT reported that acting is on", "the rise as an occupational choice for young people, and todays USAT", "Snapshot" reports that in a recent poll, 51 percent of men surveyed wouldprefer their children grew up to be a Hollywood star rather than a U.S.Senator. (Only 32 percent of the women preferred this.)            Curiously, the LAT lead puts in the second paragraph the informationthat businessman Al Checchi criticized Rep. Jane Harman for appealing toRepublicans, that Harman sniped at Checchi for having a lot of position papers,and that Lt. Gov. Gray Davis attacked them both as millionaires trying to buythe election, but delays until the fifth paragraph the news that Checchi andHarman said that as governor they would seek to repeal Prop. 209, theCalifornia ballot measure outlawing racial and gender preferences in statehiring and college admissions, and that Davis would not do this. Plus, the, "reader has to wait to the sixth paragraph to learn that Davis also wouldnt", commit to signing a bill sanctioning gay marriage, while both Checchi andHarman would do that.            The WP runs a piece inside reporting that according to Russiansources, Russian intelligence agents have, for the past several years, quietlyrecruited scientists to go to Iran and teach their Iranian counterparts how tobuild missiles to carry deadly payloads as far as 1,200 miles. The piece goeson to say that the Russians intend to stop this practice. Some observers,remarks the Post , wonder if the Russian government can in fact stop theflow of scientists to Tehran.            The WSJ brings evidence that not every conservative blindly supportsthe many turns of Ken Starr\s investigation of President Clinton. The "Rule ofLaw" piece, by a former Reagan administration deputy attorney general, arguesthat "it is time for a sober reassessment of the power we have concentrated inthe hands of prosecutors and the alarming absence of effective checks andbalances to prevent the widespread abuse of that power.", "            The two people in America who still think of the NYT as Americas", sober "paper of record," are directed to Sunday\s front section, page 20.There, instead of the dozens of straightforward shots of Robert Bennett nodoubt available, the paper opts for a shot of him with a crazed smile and handsnot quite in front his face, making him look like a spastic Mafia don., "            The WP reports on last Saturday nights Gridiron Dinner, that annual", Washington D.C. court masque in which bigfoot journalists entertain the, "governments heaviest hitters and vice-versa. The centerpiece this year was", "President Clintons monologue, which featured the following joke he said had", been approved by his lawyers: "Knock-knock" "Don\t answer that."                                                   Goldwater: A View From A Broad                           USA, "Hello and the Los Angeles Times lead with President Clintons decision to", "accept a federal judges ruling that executive privilege does not protect his", aide Sidney Blumenthal from being questioned by Kenneth Starr. Clinton willhowever, the papers report, still pursue an effort in the courts to invoke, "attorney-client privilege to block Starrs effort to question another aide,", deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey. (This story is also the off-lead atthe New York Timesand the Washington Post .) The NYT goes with the South Korean, "presidents call for the West--including the U.S.--to drop its sanctions", against North Korea, and the WP leads with the news that Mexican drugcartels are, via a new far more potent strain of heroin, gaining a growingshare of the U.S. drug trade., "            The LAT says that Clintons legal shift has the benefit of allowing", him to fight on, but on much less controversial grounds, and yet still perhaps, "delaying Lindseys re-appearance before Starrs grand jury for months. But the", NYT lead editorial still sees plenty of controversy,calling the tack a "dodge" and describing as "stonewalling" Clinton\s refusalto straight-off cooperate with Starr\s "reasonable requests for information ina legitimate criminal inquiry." What\s more, argues the Times the claimof attorney-client privilege as applied to Mr. Lindsey is "really little morethan another executive privilege claim in disguise," given that lawyer Lindseyis foremost a political and policy advisor.            Both the WP front and a piece inside at the NYT report that, "Sundays statement by President Clinton hinting at U.S. support for additional", international financial loans to shore up the Russian economy utterly failed tohave the anticipated soothing effect: Russian stocks fell another ten percentand the ruble worsened slightly., "            The Wall Street Journal s political reporting continues to be", "disarmingly candid. On the heels of a recent piece that laid bare Trent Lotts", "fund-raising, todays Journal surveys the many competing campaign reform bills on the House docket", (one dozen bills; 500 amendments) and concludes that "GOP leaders will assumethe role of full partners in overhaul legislation--in an effort to kill it." In, "the end though, observes the paper, it may be a Democrat--Michigans John", "Dingell--who seals campaign reforms fate. He has been collecting Democratic", votes for a commission that would study and recommend further changes in thesystem. (A big clue to how lightly Congress takes the issue. When Pearl Harbor, "was attacked, FDR didnt appoint a commission to study and recommend further", changes in our defense posture.)            The LAT front brings word of a legal ruling that may spell trouble for "reality" TV shows like"Cops" and the use of hidden cameras and microphones by the likes of "60Minutes" and "PrimeTime Live." The California Supreme Court ruled thataccurate, newsworthy news reports are protected by the First Amendment fromlawsuits merely alleging illegal disclosure of private facts, but the Courtalso ruled that story subjects may sue if reporters and/or photographers useoffensive or intrusive methods to get the story. The case prompting thedecision involved a woman car accident victim ministered to by a nurse wearinga tiny microphone for a TV show featuring real rescues. The woman survived butthe show broadcast her pleas to be allowed to die.                           USAT reports that billionaire George Soros has found anotherstruggling group to give aid to: poverty lawyers. Hello, says the paper, withgovernment legal aid programs on the wane, Soros will launch amultimillion-dollar initiative to fund 70 two-year public interest fellowshipsfor young law school grads, supporting their legal efforts on behalf of suchclients as battered women, the homeless, Native Americans and migrant farmworkers.            Tributes to Barry Goldwater as the last of a breed of terminallystraight-talking politicians continue pouring in, but so far, only David, "Broders encomium mentions that the late Senator once showed reporters the near-nude and suggestively inscribed photo of herself a", woman fan had sent him.            A bottom front WP story reports that yesterday Al Gore announced aninitiative to have the federal government write itsmillions of forms, directive and letters in "plain language." An example hecited is translating OSHA\s "Ways of exit access and the doors to exits towhich they lead shall be so designed and arranged as to be clearly recognizableas such" as "An exit door must be free of signs or decorations that obscure itsvisibility." The Post waggishly provides another example, effectivelyGoring the Vice-President: "There is no controlling legal authority that saysthis was in violation of the law" should be recast as "There\s no law againstit."                                                   A Sorry State of Affairs                           USAHello leads with that schoolyard shooting in Arkansas, which also makesthe front at the New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los Angeles, "Times . The WP and LAT lead with President Clintons", remarks in Uganda about how, with its slave trade, the U.S. wronged Africa. TheNYT goes with the news that the federal government has delayed issuingtens of thousands of permanent residency permits for immigrants because a new, "machine designed to produce fraud-proof green cards hasnt worked right since", it was installed last summer. Few immigrants, says the paper, will suffer direconsequences but the delay is making many of them panicky.            Four students and a teacher, all female, died, and ten others were injuredat an Arkansas middle school after two boys--ages 13 and 11--shot at theirclassmates pouring out of the school in response to the false fire alarm thetwo had pulled. It was, reports USAT , the third school rampagenationwide in five months. In recent similar incidents, students have killedfive and wounded 14.            Rising to give a speech at a village outside Kampala, after listening to oneby Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, President Clinton, according to the, "WP , launched into what his aides later said were impromptu remarks about the role the U.S. has played in Africas", tragedies. "Going back to the time before we were even a nation, EuropeanAmericans received the fruits of the slave trade," Clinton said. "And we werewrong in that." Clinton also admitted that American Cold War policy for Africatoo often resulted in mistakenly supporting ruthless dictators just becausethey were anti-communists.            All the papers point out that previously, Clinton had considered andrejected the idea of making an official apology to American blacks for slavery.It was reported that Clinton thought a mea culpa would distract from the realtasks of racial healing and could alienate white centrist voters. And indeed,reports the WP , aides repeatedly said Clinton would not issue such anapology while on the African tour. But, says the paper, Clinton was apparentlytaken by the "spirit of the moment." According to the Post , hisspur-of-the-moment thoughts caused "consternation among his travelingdelegation."            The papers note this vibe but inexplicably internalize it, and generally try, "to describe Clintons speech as something besides what it most obviously is: an", apology for slavery. The WP sees, "not strictly speaking an apology, buta remarkably all-encompassing statement of contrition." USAT , in itsoff-lead, says that with the remarks, Clinton "came as close as he ever has toapologizing for slavery, and in its lead, the LAT says he "stop[ped]short of an explicit apology." The NYT front-pager says he stopped "wellshort" of one., "            Perhaps what underlies the presidential staffs concern is that the episode", is a clear reminder that Clinton is prone in the heat of the moment to do, "things that in cooler moments he very publicly says he wouldnt do. Hoping not", to remind folks about this was one of the reasons handlers were glad to get himout of town in the first place. And indeed, such concerns explicitly followedhim to Africa: The NYT states that reporters touring the village withClinton asked if he was invoking executive privilege in the Monica Lewinskymatter. Neither the president nor Hillary responded, even though Musevenicalled after them to make sure they heard the question.            In light of the slavery speech, "Hello\s Papers" wonders how long it will be, "before one of Clintons critics complains that he apologizes for things he", "didnt do, instead of apologizing for things he did.", , "            Theres a good-news story in the WP business section--lets", "hope its true. It seems that the CEO of PepsiCo, Roger A. Enrico, has given", his [$900,000 ]salary back to the company and directed that it be used to fund, "scholarships for children of the corporations grunt-level employees. Enrico", "intends to do this indefinitely. True, Enricos annual bonus, which he is not", surrendering, is [[[$1]].8 million], but the company says the bonus will not be, "enlarged to pick up the slack. The arrangement nearly doubles the companys", scholarship outlays.            Meanwhile, the WP \s "Reliable Source" column reports that on Monday,, "two Washington D.C. bookstores were ordered to turn over to Ken Starr sales records of purchases by Monica Lewinsky. Lewinskys", lawyer, William Ginsburg is quoted in the Post with this reaction: "Wehave now gone from invasion of the right of privacy to Fahrenheit451 ."            And on tour with the president in Africa, JesseJackson gives Maureen Dowd his theology of the Lewinsky scandal: "There arenine more Commandments."                                                   Prop.-aganda            A high-fatality, high-injury train wreck in Germany leads at USA Hello andthe New York, "Times --and pictures of it are on everybodys front. The looming", post-primary fight to reinstate public school bilingual education in California, "leads at the Los Angeles Times . The Washington Post goes with the governments decision to", lower what counts as obesity, thereby instantly classifying millions of, "Americans as overweight. They wont be able to become thin again by leaving the", country either: the new rules are more in line with those wielded elsewhere.The Post notes that one of the critics of the move is C. Everett Koop,who worries that it will discourage people from trying to lose weight., "            Theres a lot in the papers about Tuesdays California primaries. The", LAT lead reports that in the wake of the passage of Prop.227, which ends bilingual education for most students after one year, eightschool districts applied for waivers, but that the state school board willprobably not grant them. Meanwhile, says the LAT , a coalition of civilrights groups opposing the measure has filed a federal lawsuit. And according, "to USAT s front, the superintendent of San Francisco schools says his", system will not comply with the new law while waiting for the lawsuit to beresolved. Similarly, the LAT reports that as many as 1,500 L.A. teacherssay they may commit the "equivalent of educational civil disobedience" by notteaching in English. The story offers a quotation from one teacher saying justthat, but the reader is left mystified as to where the paper came up with the1,500 figure. Another curiosity: the piece delays until the seventh paragraphthe information that recently, 48 percent of those participating in a L.A.teachers union election voted for ending bilingual instruction. Statistics, "appearing elsewhere on the papers front also make it clear that this is a more", nuanced issue than the LAT generally makes it seem: 37 percent ofLatinos voted against continued bilingualism, as did 57 percent of Asians.            A NYT editorial says the defeat in California of several super-richcandidates "may cause multimillionaires to rethink their plans for midlifecareer changes." And a front-page WP piece says this development shows, "that with the economy on the rise, the electorates distaste for professional", politicians is on the wane            The NYT , WP and the LAT (which carries the WPstory) fronts all report that the FDA has given a company permission to conduct, "the worlds first full-scale test of an anti-HIV infection", vaccine. The experiment will be conducted with 5,000 uninfectedparticipants over the next four years. All the pieces mention that such a study, "has an inherent conflict: science says dont do anything to cloud the role of", the vaccine, while ethics says do everything. But none give the reader any idea, "how this problem can be resolved, and so its hard to see how the proposed", vaccine tests can avoid coming acropper like the recent controversial AIDSresearch in Africa these papers reported on at some length.            The Wall Street Journal continues to pass along good news forthe auto industry. The latest: sales of cars and light trucks were up 12percent in May. Special incentive deals have been driving things, so the trend, "could cool soon, but in the meantime its producing some tremendous numbers: GM", minivans, for instance, are up 60.6 percent over a year ago, and for GM sedans,the surge is 85.7 percent., "            Everybodys inside carries word that President Clinton notified Congress", that he will ask for yet another year of Most Favored Nation status for China,meaning that China will continue to enjoy the tariff and trade treatmentextended to most other countries trading with the U.S. The WSJ pointsout that with the recent ethical and national security controversies, "surrounding China, Clinton is now spotlighting Beijings value as a broker for", peace between India and Pakistan.            In a WP op-ed titled "I Didn\t Get Dumped," former MonicaLewinsky attorney William Ginsburg settles scores on his way out of town.Decrying the insular nature of D.C.\s political/legal culture, he observes, "Aperson apparently needs a passport to get into Washington." Then comes theself-praise: "I am.a hell of a trial lawyer, with an innate sense of right andwrong and up for any fight, even with an anti-constitutional monster." And thetired excoriation of the press: "To my detractors and the naysayers out there,otherwise known as "talking heads," or "kibitzers," I say, bah humbug!" Anddon\t forget the Bulworth reference: "My former client is now representedby.new counsel, and while I will remain a spirit, not a ghost, they must goforward and represent her as they know best how to do." All this prose doesnothing so much as convince the reader that Mr. Ginsburg has something incommon with his former client: he probably blew it.                                                   Depo Charge                           USAHello , the New York Times ,, "and the Los Angeles Times lead with yesterdays unanimous Supreme", Court decision that the law barring sexual discrimination in the workplaceapplies equally to harassment between workers of the same sex. The Washington Post , which runs the Supreme Court story near, "the top, goes instead with the most detailed account yet of President Clintons", deposition in the Paula Jones case. "Hello\s Papers" couldn\t help but notice, "that President Clinton didnt comment on the important step the Supreme Court", took to keep the workplace safe from sexual harassment., "            Its just common sense that same sex doesnt automatically mean no", harassment, but the reporting on the decision makes it clear that thelegalities have been murky. According to the NYT , the law of sexual harassment is basically a recent SupremeCourt creation, and broadening its application has met with hostility in lower, "courts. The NYT reports that Justice Antonin Scalias opinion for the", Court--issued in the case of a male oil-rig worker complaining about histreatment by male co-workers--says the acid test for harassment is not the sexor motivation of the parties, but whether there is sex-based discrimination inthe workplace "so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of thevictim\s employment."            Scalia, notes the Times , went on to claim that the decision does notabrogate all "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and womenroutinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex," and, "all the papers give his example: a football coach slapping a players rear on", the way to the field would be lawful, while the same gesture directed at the, "coachs (female or male) secretary might not be. All the dailies note that the", decision drew praise from civil rights and gay rights advocates., "            Its interesting to compare the harassment headlines. The NYT says,", "High Court Widens Workplace Claims of Sex Harassment." This is much less clearthan USAT \s "Same-sex Harassment Illegal." (The LAT has virtuallythis same to-the-point headline.)            The Post runs its Clinton lead clear across the top. And once again, photoeditors in effect put an opinion on the front page. The accompanying picture ofClinton has to be the least attractive one of him ever published: Eyes hooded,JFK-style, talking out of one side of his mouth., "            This story, about Clintons January 17th deposition, represents the most", elaborate press account yet of his description of his relationship with MonicaLewinsky. Clinton testified, says the paper, that the two exchanged gifts andthat she visited him in his office perhaps five times, and that they may havebeen alone together. The president denied having sexual relations withLewinsky, which for the purposes of the deposition was defined as fondling andoral sex, but not kissing on the mouth. Clinton said it was his secretary BettyCurrie who initiated career help for Lewinsky.            In the deposition, Clinton denied that he propositioned Paula Jones and alsodenied having sex with three other women he was asked about. He did, however,, "say that hed had sex with Gennifer Flowers--just once, in 1977.", , "            The Post reports that often during the proceedings five hours,", Clinton had to be asked to speak up. And, says the paper, at a couple ofpoints, he reacted to something that was said in a "frustrated outburst." It\sodd that the WP was able to find this out without finding out whatprompted it.            The story gives a good picture of the personal degradation involved forClinton in giving the deposition: there were seventeen people in attendance.Obviously, at least one of them was the source for this story. Place your moneyon Paula Jones and/or one of her six (!) lawyers.                           USAT , the LAT , and the NYT all go front page with thenews that choke-out thug Latrell Sprewell was given his gazilliondollar contract back by an arbitrator. Everybody has this quote from NBAcommissioner David Stern: "You cannot strike your boss and still hold yourjob--unless you play in the NBA...."            The WP reports that, voting along racial lines, the Mississippi stateSenate yesterday rejected a proposal to compensate relatives of those killed inthe state in hate crimes during the civil rights era. Sen. Richard White isquoted as saying, "I don\t think we need to....start scratching thesesores.", "            Michael Kellys WP column about Ken Starr vs. Sidney", "Blumenthal has one of the more striking author disclaimers youll ever see:", "....(full disclosure: I worked with Blumenthal at the New Yorker anddidn\t like him.)"                                                   Gates at the Barbarians                           USAHello leads with the Starr grand jury appearance of Vernon Jordan. TheWashington Post leads with the first-time-evercongressional testimony of Bill Gates. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the report that the U.N.-approved oil-for-foodexceptions to the trade sanctions on Iraq have primarily benefited SaddamHussein and his inner circle. The New York Timesleads with the strong showing of a Hindu nationalist party in the Indianparliamentary elections. Neither the LAT nor NYT leads make, "anybody elses front page. Jordan and Gates, on the other hand, get lots of", attention everywhere., "            Its widely reported that Jordan testified for more than five hours, and", that he answered every question--mostly about the nature of the career planningassistance he extended to Monica L. as a favor to the president. USATsays Jordan\s appearance marks a "pivotal stage" in the Lewinsky investigation., "The WP and NYT stress that Jordans courthouse-steps affirmation", of his friendship with President Clinton was mighty reassuring to the WhiteHouse. Both the WP and NYT note the fancy Jordan securityarrangements--the Post calls them "almost royal treatment." He ate hislunch ("hearty vegetable soup"--thanks WP ) surrounded by three federalbodyguards, just a few tables over from the unguarded prosecutors who had beengrilling him.            The WP lead says that Gates was "assailed" at the hearings, forsuppressing competition, by some of the business rivals he appeared with, as, "well as by some senators. Gates response that government intervention, not his", company, is the big threat to technological innovation, is widely quoted. Buthearing chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch opined afterwards that Microsoft is amonopoly. An idea, says the LAT , Gates "scoffs" at., "            The Post points out that the Senate doesnt even allow laptop", computers in its chamber, but that nonetheless some of the questioning of Gatesby Hatch had a "laser-like precision." The LAT and NYT describe Gates as, "the richest man in America. The WP says hes the richest man in the", world.            The Gates appearance certainly brings out criticism of his Slatediary entries. The WP \s "Reliable Source" column says, "A scintillatingread, they are not," and Maureen Dowd says they make Gates\ life "sound asboring as ours."            According to the Wall Street Journal "Tax Report," as of last Friday, theIRS had issued 12% more money in income-tax refunds than the year before. The, "IRS says thats because more people are filing electronically.", , "            Theres considerable coverage today given to a seven word addition Vermont", Sen. Patrick Leahy inserted in a bill about federal Great Lake research moneythat had the effect of making his state eligible for the funds for the firsttime. The sentence declares Lake Champlain to be a Great Lake. The bill will,says the NYT , probably be signed by President Clinton. George Will makes fun of the move in his column and a, "NYT editorial points out that other lakes, such as Utahs", Great Salt Lake, are far better claimants. The editorial runs under the header,"Maybe It\s An Ocean.", "            Its a shame federal monies are used up this way when they could be better", "used for things like the governments program to provide close captioning for", "television shows. But then we learn in todays Post that the program", funds captioning for "Jerry Springer" and "Baywatch." ("Hello\sPapers" didn\t even realize those shows have soundtracks.)                                                   Galluping Off to War?                           USAHello leads with new poll results indicating that Americans are evenmore hawkish about Iraq than the White House. The Washington Post and New York Times, "go with U.S. maneuvers to limit U.N. Secretary-General Annans ability to", independently negotiate with Saddam Hussein. And the Los AngelesTimes leads with the Clinton administration push for tighter regulationof managed care.            In the latest USAT /CNN/Gallup Poll, 76 percent of respondents approveof air strikes, while 60 percent go beyond the Clinton administration and alsosupport the use of ground troops against Iraq. And by two to one, thosesurveyed support the idea of removing Saddam from power over President, "Clintons goal of merely substantially reducing his ability to use weapons of", mass destruction. The NYT front seems to find a more conflicted public:"While most people seem to believe the United States should take action againstIraq, there is plenty of doubt, and almost universal exasperation that Americanforces might once again be placed in harm\s way." But USAT does findthat support for removing Saddam falls significantly when questions assumedsubstantial U.S. or Iraqi casualties, or damage to U.S. ties with Araballies.            The NYT , WP , and USAT leads all report that the U.S.was instrumental in keeping the five permanent members of the U.N. Security, "Council from endorsing Annans goal of going to Baghdad to independently", negotiate a settlement. The U.S. position is to accept nothing less than totalweapons inspection access.            The Wall Street Journal and WP fronts continue the, "dailies rather unprecedented disclosure of the current thinking of U.S. war", planners. The Journal says that even with a new wavelet of improved, "weapons, the top brass doubts that the air attacks theyre planning can", "destroy all of Iraqs most terrible weapons or even change Saddams behavior.", Among the grounds for doubt ticked off by the Journal : U.S. targeters, "arent really sure where the special weapons plants are, and dont know what to", do about "dual use" targets like hospitals that are also used to producebiological weapons. The Post reports, based on several unnamedwell-placed Pentagon sources, that unlike in the Gulf War, the preponderance ofplanned strikes are now targeted against so-called "leadership" targets: not so much air defense sites or depots, as,for example, secret police headquarters. The paper says the administration, "doesnt want to advertise this.",             The LAT lead about managed care reform covers ground, "first staked out by a NYT lead a few months ago. The reason its back in", the news is that legislation drafted by Democrats that requires federalstandards for health insurance plans and an appeals process to enforce themwill be taken up when Congress returns from recess next week. The managed care, "industry and the nations largest employers will fight this vehemently, the", LAT says., "            Despite Bill Clintons public pledge to cooperate fully with Ken Starrs", investigation, the LAT front reports that the president has been using"one of the best tools available" for frustrating a criminalinvestigation--namely, entering into joint defense agreements with others beinginvestigated in the case. Such agreements, says the paper, have allowed the, "presidents defense team to learn what questions are being posed and what", answers given during grand jury sessions. The paper suggests that both, "Clintons secretary Betty Currie and White House steward Bayani Nelvis have", entered into such agreements with BC. Presidential lawyers tell the LATthat they expect Starr to challenge these agreements.            All too often the contemporary newspaper correction resembles one of thosejoke business cards that say, "See other side" on both sides. Witness today\s correction in the WP : "In an article Sunday,former CIA director Robert M. Gates said that during the 1991 Persian Gulf War,U.S. officials were "hoping" that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would bekilled in a bombing raid. The headline on the story incorrectly characterizedU.S. policy regarding Saddam Hussein\s death." Notice that this doesn\t includeeither the original headline or an explanation of the way in which it was, "incorrect in its characterization. Its only when the reader digs out the", "Sunday article that he learns the headline referred to Saddams death as a Gulf", War "goal." By hiding the ball this way, the Post misses the chance toexplore the intelligence community sophistry at work here. Ordinarily, if youhope for something and do things that ordinarily could be expected to bring itabout, then it would count as one of your goals. But because the U.S.government operates under a presidential executive order forbidding theassassination of foreign leaders, U.S. military planners who want to eliminate, "a foreign leader have to perfect the mental trick of hoping for e.g. Saddams", death as they plan to e.g. bomb the building where they know he sleeps, but atthe same time being genuinely surprised if he were to die as a result.                                                   Suharto Say Goodbye            The continuing Indonesia turmoil leads at USA Hello andthe New York Timesand is the top non-local story at the Washington Post and Los Angeles, "Times . Suhartos surprise announcement that he would step down failed", to ease political tensions, because he described a gradual and vague transitionto a successor, and the thousands of student protesters want him out now. "Iftomorrow Suharto does not step down, there will be a lot of trouble," oneprotester tells USAT . The LAT says it now seems likely Suhartowill go., "            The papers say that the nations top opposition leader had called for a", million demonstrators to take to the streets of Jakarta, and that the military,, "primarily via stern television messages, urged them not to. The WP s", veteran correspondent Keith Richburg says the scene at the Indonesian parliament, where students havetaken over the grounds and buildings, is "eerily reminiscent of Beijing\sTiananmen Square." Mirroring earlier reporting, the NYT says relations between the students and troops appearfriendly.            A State Department spokesman is quoted in USAT and the WPsaying that because of the upheaval, the IMF will probably delay delivery ofits next bailout payment. The World Bank has already done this.            The WP confuses with a front-page piece asking whether comparing, "health insurers reimbursement handling of Viagra to their handling of birth", control pills reveals a bias towards men. The second paragraph of the story saysthat more than half of Viagra prescriptions are being subsidized by healthplans, and the sixth paragraph says that slightly more than half of all birth, "control pills are. Wheres the bias? Why do we need this story?", , "            The NYT s front reports on the first hard political consequences of", the China money-for-missile-technology charges it aired last week: Newt, "Gingrich announced Tuesday hell seek to set up a special House panel to look into the allegations. The story also", makes the USAT front, where Gingrich is quoted saying, "This a deeperquestion than anything that has arisen before in this administration." Gingrichalso tells the paper that President Clinton should not embark on a planned tripto China until he answers to Congress.            A shocking episode reported in a buried wire story in, "yesterdays WP moves up to page two in todays Post . Last", Saturday while playing basketball near a hospital emergency room, a fifteenyear-old boy was shot. Emergency room doctors and nurses were notified of thesituation by a police officer, but citing hospital policy, they refused toleave the emergency room to come to his aid--thirty-five feet away. And refusedto lend the cop a gurney. Ninety minutes later, the boy was dead. "I will befinishing my thirty-fourth year as an officer," said the policeman, "and I havenever seen anything like this."            The editorials continue to weigh in on the lawsuits brought againstMicrosoft. The LAT lead editorial, "Bill Gates is Wrong," takes exceptionto Gates\ Coke/Pepsi analogy by saying, "Microsoft\s ambition to have Windowsplay an integral role in virtually every American lifestyle is more like Coketelling Americans that from now on it will be their beverage, main course anddessert." (It seems that the law of beverage monopoly is wondrouslycomplex--"Hello\s Papers" recalls not being able to bring its own beer intoDodger Stadium and not being able to get a Coke at a Taco Bell.) In any case,, "warns the LAT , if Microsoft doesnt compromise, it could find itself", being broken up by the Justice Department into "Baby Bills."            Remember that scene in "Sleeper" where it\s revealed that in the futureeverybody knows the only really healthy substances are red meat and cigarettes?Well, today\s WP runs a story headlined "Smoking May Protect Some High-Risk Womenfrom Breast Cancer." Seems that for two types of breast cancer that comprise, "about ten percent of all cases, whats lucky is a...Lucky.",             A front-page Wall Street Journal feature visits the mercenary mouthsbehind political campaign commercials. A small coterie of voice-overspecialists, it turns out, earn over [$500,000] a year narrating the commercialsfor hundreds of candidates. New phone technology allows them to do this fromtheir own houses with assembly-line efficiency and relieves them of the onerouschore of actually meeting the candidates. One of these elite announcers,reports the Journal , once inadvertently worked for both sides of acampaign.                                                   Butt Heads Butt Heads, "            The en masse defection of the major tobacco manufacturers from Congress", efforts at a settlement leads everywhere. The industry promises to immediatelylaunch a public relations offensive against a "coercive, Big Brother-typeCongress." The Washington Post says the campaign kicks off today withnewspaper ads reading, "We Agreed To Change The Way We Do Business . . . Not ToGo Out Of Business." Everybody quotes President Clinton\s determined reaction:"They can be part of it or they can fight it," although oddly, USA Helloleaves out the most important part of his quote: "We\re going to get thisdone."            The tobacco stance became official with a speech against the tough andexpensive Senate bill by the RJR CEO, Steven Goldstone, described by the papersas "aggressive" and "defiant." Goldstone is widely quoted as saying,"Washington has rushed to collect more tobacco revenues while playing thepolitics of punishment." USAT quotes him describing the process as"broken beyond repair." The Los Angeles Times adds that Goldstone raised thespecter of a thriving black market in cigarettes if the Senate bill were tobecome law.            The New York Timesand USAT point out that while Congress can proceed unilaterally in manyareas of the proposed legislation, this is problematic with the provisions thattouch on the curtailment of free speech, such as advertising restrictions.Goldstone is quoted in the Times saying that if Congress imposes theseanyway, the companies "will fight in court." Feelings are running just as highon the other side. The paper quotes the reaction of Sen. Kent Conrad: "Poorbabies." Both the NYT and WP note that Conrad expressed the ideathat all this tobacco manufacturer stridency is a stratagem designed to get thecurrent deal accepted without the addition of any harsher conditions.            The NYT is admirably clear about the context producing suchskepticism: "The tobacco industry has dissembled so often in the past--aboutwhether cigarettes cause diseases, about whether nicotine is addictive, aboutwhether they market their product to children--that people are never sure whatto make of the companies\ pronouncements." Now, if only the Times hadsaid "lied" instead of "dissembled"...            The Wall Street Journal seems a little less surprised by allthis, claiming that "the reality is that tobacco companies for weeks have beenclosed out of the legislative process." The Journal also sends alongword that Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, an architect of last, "summers original tobacco deal, says he understands the industry position and", calls on President Clinton and Congress to convene new negotiations.            And lest we forget what this is all about, the WP reports that, "a study in todays New England Journal of Medicine", suggests that non-smokers not only live longer, but have less sickness anddependence on others in their last years.            The WSJ and WP each run stories describing a new studypurporting to show that the differences between black and white investors areconsiderable. Among those with incomes above [[$50,000]], only 57 percent of theblacks had money in the stock market, compared to 81 percent of the whites. Andwhile only 13 percent of the whites believed Social Security will provide atleast half their retirement income, 25 percent of blacks thought this.            The NYT front reports that President Clinton has ordered the Departments of Defense, State, andJustice to devise plans for the arrest and trial of Pol Pot, the KhmerRouge leader responsible for the death of perhaps a million Cambodians in the1970s. According to the paper, the opportunity presents itself because theKhmer Rouge, which has Pol Pot under house arrest, is in complete disarray.Hmmm...wonder if the Khmer Rouge subscribes to the Times ...            In a NYT op-ed, Andrew Sullivan assesses the career thus far of themilitary\s "don\t ask, don\t tell" policy. Sullivan notes that under thepolicy, discharges of homosexuals have increased 67 percent (80 percent if youfigure in downsizing). Bill Clinton, Sullivan observes, has now fired morehomosexuals than any other employer in America.            The front page of the NYT national edition brings word that, buoyedby the soaring approval ratings of the sex-scandalized Bill Clinton, the, "sex-scandalized Bob Packwood wants to get back in the game. Hes thinking about", running for the Oregon state legislature. "Hello\s Papers" has just thecampaign slogan for him: "Still Packing Wood."                                                   Goodbye, Columbus?            The Washington Post and New York Times, "lead with the Clinton administrations post-Columbus moves to shore up public", support for its Iraq stance, with the Post reporting that critics of aU.S. air assault now include Jimmy Carter. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the brewing dispute between Kenneth Starr and seniorClinton aides he is questioning over whether or not they are relieved fromanswering by executive privilege. USA Helloleads with the arrest of two men, one of them a neo-Nazi, for possession ofsuspected anthrax for use as a weapon. Allegedly, the men were plotting todeploy the agent in the New York City subway system--yeah right, like anthraxcould survive that. The anthrax story also makes the NYT and LATfronts, but is pushed inside at the WP .            The WP reports that President Clinton warned Saddam Hussein not to mistake theskeptical questions raised at the raucous Columbus forum as a sign thatAmericans lack resolve for military action. This comment came, says thePost , as a new poll shows 63 percent of respondents support bombing Iraq, "if it doesnt stop interfering with weapons inspectors. The polls fine points", are a little more confusing, however. 56 percent of the respondents say theU.S. should try to force Saddam from power, but 56 percent also say they opposea U.S. invasion with ground troops. This sort of free-lunch result is an, "American polling staple--its just like all those polls that show folks want a", balanced budget, but not higher taxes or reduced Social Security or Medicarebenefits., "            The NYT s coverage of the hearts and mind stage of the", Iraq run-up suggests more of an uphill battle than does the WP \s: "A dayafter U.S. policy toward Iraq was passionately picked apart at a town hallmeeting in Ohio, President Clinton tried to reassemble the pieces.."            The NYT reports this comment on the Columbus protests made by Sen.Barbara Mikulski of Maryland to Clinton as he appeared with her at an event onThursday: "You and the first lady weren\t exactly angelic a couple of yearsago. I don\t think you\ve done too bad being a protester."            The LAT lead states that presidential confidant Bruce Lindseydeclined to answer some questions during his two-day Starr grand juryappearance, which, the paper says, set the stage for a "Watergate-style battle"over the use of executive privilege.            A NYT editorial weighs in on this dispute, taking theposition that as long as Starr\s questions "stick to the pertinent issues," andstay out of say, "military options in Iraq," they should be answered. Ofcourse, what counts as pertinent to Whitewater has already been loosenedconsiderably, and could get looser. If, for instance, there was prima facieevidence that President Clinton had discussed Iraq moves with Lewinsky, then bythe same logic that got us here, Ken Starr would be entitled to question herabout that too.                           USAT reports that Vernon Jordan met four times with Lewinsky, butnever mentions that this was first reported yesterday by the WP .            "Well, O.K., maybe not all our promises." The LAT front andthe WP inside feature stories stating that Promise Keepers is sostrapped financially that it will soon stop paying its 345 salariedemployees.            The Wall Street Journal main "Politics and Policy" piece has atidy break-out of lessons learned by both sides in the Gulf War. According to, "the Journal , its US: Minimize casualties, both civilian and military;", stealth technology works; precision-guided munitions work; you need to be ableto deploy quickly; and air power is more effective now than in the past. And, "Saddam: Survival is victory; Americans dont like casualties on either side;", bring in foreign TV, but not foreign print reporters; portray yourself as thevictim, not the bully, and don\t slug it out, but "shoot and scoot." The papersays Pentagon officials suspect the Iraqi secret police may be keeping thebodies of executed political prisoners in cold storage, to be blown up anddistributed wherever American bombs drop., "            The WSJ has these Monica tidbits: 1) Vernon Jordan isnt part of the", joint defense agreement entered into by many other grand-jury witnesses withWhite House ties. 2) The House Judiciary Committee is making plans to hire 18"new" lawyers for a possible impeachment inquiry. For the sake of the republic,"Hello\s Papers" hopes the Journal means "additional."

Pakistans possible imminent", "test of a nuclear bomb leads at USA Hello, and the Washington Post, and is also the subject of a Wall Street Journal piece tipped high in the papers front-page", news box. The confirmation by experts that last week India detonated a hydrogenbomb leads at the New York Times. And the Los Angeles Times, "goes with the Group of Eights struggle to devise a nuclear strategy.", , "            Pakistans foreign minister said Sunday that despite appeals from President", Clinton and other world leaders, his government has decided to conduct anuclear test, reports USAT , the NYT and the WSJ . And thisis what the USAT and WSJ headlines say. But the papers alsoreport that others in the government say the decision has not been made yet.WP quotes Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had just leftPakistan, as saying that his delegation left believing the Pakistanis werestill undecided. The LAT sums up the situation with its off-leadheadline "Pakistan Sends Mixed Signals." President Clinton is quoted byUSAT saying that a Pakistan test is "a nutty way to go." The G-8 summit, "refused to follow Clintons lead and impose sanctions against India, reports", USAT , instead issuing a resolution condemning its nuclear testing. TheLAT calls this a "toothless statement."            Meanwhile, according to USAT and the NYT , India ratcheted thesituation with its announcement that its nuclear missile program is all butready. The Times explains this means the country now has a nuke that canbe delivered from a plane, or launched from the ground or the sea. According toIndian scientists, says the NYT , the hydrogen bomb (code-named Shakti-1,from the Hindi word for "power") they set off is considerably smaller than thelargest hydrogen bombs tested by the U.S., Russia and the other establishednuclear powers. The Indians say they kept their bomb "small" to avoid damage tonearby populated villages. One Indian scientist quoted by the Times saysof larger bombs, "If there is a demand, we will do it." An American experttells the paper that Indian claims about having exploded a hydrogen bomb andbeing able to explode bigger ones is quite believable. The Times says, "Western experts have known that Pakistan could build an atomic bomb, but arent", sure about a hydrogen bomb.            As with its reporting on the original Indian announcement of the tests lastweek, the Times captures the national pride they have inspired, afeeling the paper likens to the way we felt about our original astronauts., "Cheers were heard, for instance, on the videotape of last Mondays blasts.", , "            Sundays NYT front ran a Jeff Gerth/David Sanger piece reporting at", "length on what was suggested in Fridays Gerth piece on the Chinese/DNC", "connection: that the Chinese monies paved the way for President Clintons", "approval of the export of satellite technology to China. In todays", Times , USAT and the WP , Clinton is quoted, "All theforeign policy decisions we made were based on what we believed...were in thebest interests of the American people." In his column today, William Safirecalls Clinton the "Proliferation President," arguing that his willingness to, "export the technology strengthened Chinas satellite and missile technology,", which scared India into joining the nuclear club, which scared Pakistan, whichChina can now aid with advanced missile weaponry.            In a WP op-ed, budget analyst Scott Hodge takes a look at the [[[$20]0]]billion highway bill, which, critics claim, is full of gold-plated projects., "Actually, argues Hodge, its worse than that: it would be far cheaper--less", than half the cost--if the entire Interstate Highway System was justgold-plated.            According to information in Sunday\s NYT "Week in Review," there\sone respect in which India has no peer in the nuclear club: Almost half a, "billion of its citizens dont have toilets.",                                                    Emerging Measures            The Citicorp and Travelers Group deal--the largest corporate merger ever--is, "everybodys lead. Associated business and policy and personality stories take", "up much of the rest of the days news hole.",             The resulting insurance, banking and securities company will be calledCitigroup (narrowly edging out Travelerscorp, Groupcorp, Corpgroup,Corptravelers, and Groupciti, we hear) and will become the fifth largest, "American corporation. The newspapers accounts of the size of the deal vary", somewhat: the New York Times, "says its [[$70] billion], the Washington Post says [$82 billion]. USA Hello ,", the Los, "Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal say its [$83 billion]. The NYT", "figure apparently doesnt take into account the increase in the companies", shares during the Wall St. explosion--the Dow closed over 9000 for the firsttime ever--the deal touched off.            The papers report that the new financial services company will offer"one-stop shopping" for consumers and corporations. The NYT andWP are somewhat breathless about the possibility, but the LAT, "says its not at all clear that consumers want this, noting that previous", efforts to offer it have "generally failed." The WSJ elaborates, pointing out that previoushigh-profile attempts by American Express and Sears to cross-pollinate withWall St. partners failed. In addition, notes the Journal , creating ahuge full-service financial edifice flies in the face of the trend towarddiscount brokerage firms and cheap on-line trading.            The dailies emphasize that the most striking part of the deal is thatcurrent laws, in force since the Depression, prevent financial cross-selling onthis scale. The deal boldly challenges all this, says the WP , puttingpressure on Congress and regulators to change the status quo, in the next fiveyears before the deal goes into full effect. The NYT calls this featureremarkable "brashness," and the LAT says it is its "most remarkableaspect." Another pressure factor is that it\s widely believed this merger willinspire other similar ones.            Another unusual aspect of the deal drawing lots of comment is that, "Travelers Sanford Weill and Citicorps John Reed have decided to rule their", new kingdom as co-CEOs. A piece on the USAT "Money" front page saysexperts are dubious about the arrangement. The WSJ wonders if the twomen can "merge their egos." And the NYT business section piece on therelationship runs under the header, "The Odd Couple."            Weill and Reed are quoted as saying the merger will not produce large-scalelayoffs. But, notes the WSJ , layoffs of over 1,000 employees followed, "each of Weills previous big deals.",             As has become common in merger reporting, some of the papers attempt tocloak the event in intrigue and drama. The Journal and the NYTtry to summon atmosphere with their descriptions of early meetings where thetop dogs sniffed each other. And the WP says "the excitement waspalpable" during Monday\s news conference at the Waldorf announcing the merger,with the arrival of Weill and Reed reminding the paper of nothing so much as"the arrival of movie stars at the Academy Awards." But the excitement is notinfectious: after all, what you have here basically is suits writing checks tothemselves., "            Indeed, the only real corrective to all the days money euphoria comes in", the WP front-page piece, "Boom Is Fine--If You OwnStock," which notes that six of every ten American households still do notown any shares of anything.            The LAT front reports that the California Supreme Court handed adefeat to unwed fathers with its ruling Monday that a man who fathers a childwith a women who is married to someone else may be denied all legal parentalrights. As the paper points out, this is significant in a state where a thirdof the children are born to couples who are not married to each other., "            If you missed the two top stories in yesterdays USAT --the", "governments first post-deregulation attempt to preserve competitiveness among", airlines and the emergence of a drug that can prevent breast cancer--they are, "on the NYT s front today.",             The WP runs a piece inside reporting that during a church service, "last Sunday, Cardinal John OConnor of New York criticized President", Clinton from the pulpit for taking Catholic communion while in SouthAfrica. The South African priest who invited Clinton to do so is quoted in thepaper as saying that once Clinton stood up, he was thinking about "how muchembarrassment it would have caused him by my saying, please sit down."            Novelist Lucian Truscott IV, a former Army officer and son and grandson of, "generals, writes a NYT op-ed in support of the Clinton administrations", latest assault weapons ban. Truscott compares the intensive training you get in, "the Army with one of these weapons long before youre ever allowed to fire it,", and then only under the supervision of an expert marksman, with the situationin states like Arkansas, where "it\s legal for a 10-year-old to own asemiautomatic assault weapon without a moment of safety instruction, trainingin how to shoot it or adult supervision."

The national edition of the New YorkTimes leads with the U.S. decision to give Benjamin Netanyahu two moreweeks to reply to its proposal that Israel undertake a more substantialwithdrawal from the West Bank. But the later metro edition of the Timesleads with news of an imminent [[[[$60 ]billion]]] phone company merger. The Los Angeles Times, "goes with Sinn Feins overwhelming endorsement of the Northern Ireland peace", deal.            The 737 inspections ordered by the FAA last week (which USAT aloneled with on Friday) were apparently well warranted: 13 of the first 26 fuelmain fuel pump wires checked showed wear on their insulation, says USAT .The WP is a little more reader-friendly about the actualnumber of planes involved: it says every one of the first 13 planes checkedshow some insulation chafing (the NYT , in its front-page story, says instead that this wastrue of a majority of the first 13 planes looked at), and that the groundingorder affects 179 U.S. planes and 193 others worldwide. The Post alsohelpfully explains that the order only affects planes at least 16 years old.USAT reports that one 737 with 60,000 flight hours showed clear signs ofsparking in one location inside its main tank and bare wire in another. This isof concern because electrical sparking inside a fuel tank is now suspected ofhaving brought down TWA Flight 800. (The story is also front-page at theLAT .), "            SBC Communications (formerly Southwestern Bell), the Wests dominant local", phone company is, reports the Times , set to acquire Ameritech, its counterpart in the Midwest, thus becoming, "the nations largest local phone company and recreating much of the old Bell", phone system. The paper reminds those scoring at home that the [[[[$60 ]billion]]], "merger is the second largest in corporate history, trailing only Marchs [$70]", billion Citicorp/Travelers Group union. (And if you are meticulously updatingyour copy of this list, odds are you are not scoring at home.) The lengthyWall Street Journal account points out that unlike many ofthe recent mergers, which have at least attempted a merger of the CEOs as well,in this deal the Ameritech brass are bailing out (with golden parachutes ofcourse). The story also makes the USAT front., "            The deep thoughts of televisions top executives as they existentially", struggle with life after Seinfeld are on display in a NYT front-pageeffort by its TV bigfoot Bill Carter.

A little story, yes,but leave it to a Post reader to see the larger point. Why, HowardFenton asks, in a letter to the editor today, does the Pentagon of all placeshave to contract out for protective services?                                       , "            Clintons New Organ Policy",                            USAHello leads with a Clinton administration proposal for new rulesgoverning transplant organ availability. The New York Times, "goes with the decision by Switzerlands three biggest banks to negotiate a", global settlement with Holocaust victims by setting up a compensation fund. Theplan does not include the Swiss government, whose central bank received thevast majority of wealth stolen by Nazis from Jews and other persecuted groups.The Los, "Angeles Times leads with depressing news about Californias second-tier", state college system: an overwhelming number of its incoming students lack thebasic math and English skills they should have acquired in high school. TheWashington Post lead headline is a hardy perennial,relating to one of the worst public education systems in the country: "D.C.Schools Chief Resigns."            The new transplant rules, explains the USAT lead (and front-pagepieces in the WP , and the NYT ), aim at providing organs to thesickest candidates first regardless of where they live, as opposed to the, "current ones, which were conceived when organs couldnt be maintained outside", the body for nearly as long as they can now, and hence emphasize getting themto the closest candidates. The private network that coordinates most organdistribution opposes the shift, because of a fear that this change will atrophylocal transplant centers by diverting organs to a handful of large regional, "ones, and also deny organs to people who cant travel. The papers all point out", that under the status quo, more than 4,000 Americans die annually while waitingfor needed organs.            The LAT front reports that just two days before the NCAA Final Fourtournament game, a federal grand jury in Chicago has indicted two former Northwestern University players on charges ofattempting to fix the outcome of games for the benefit of bettors during the1994-1995 college season. This is a "stinging blow" to the sport, says thepaper, because Northwestern has the reputation of placing academics aboveathletics. The NYT runs the indictments story inside, adding that anationwide survey of Division I basketball and football players showed that 4percent said they had gambled on a game they had played in.            The papers note that Bill Clinton appeared in South Africa yesterdayalongside Nelson Mandela, but none could be bothered to put their stories aboutthe appearance--simply unthinkable as recently as four or five years ago--onthe front page. All the visit gets is front-page pictures with "reefer"captions pointing to stories inside. This judgment is especially hard to, "understand given yesterdays GOP charges that some spots in Clintons traveling", delegation were in effect sold to mega donors to Democratic Party coffers,making the trip a sort of flying Lincoln bedroom. By the way, over anon-descript editorial, the WP serves up the perfect headline forClinton\s apology-strewn safari: "Guilt Trip."            Front-page pieces in the NYT and USAT report that one of theJonesboro shooting suspects is asking for his pastor and the other is cryingfor his mother. And an inside NYT piece addresses the question raisedyesterday by TP about what the rules are nowadays governing identifying juveniles in thepaper. Almost every editor questioned says the crucial fact pushingdisclosure was that the names were already out there, in the local paper and onthe Internet. This is another example, like the tabloidization of themainstream press, where the dwarfs have ended up controlling the giants.            The Wall Street Journal reports that Senate Judiciary CommitteeChairman Orrin Hatch is demanding that Microsoft allow its licensees andpartners to speak with Senate investigators despite nondisclosure rules in MS, "contracts. Backing the demand is the committees ranking Democrat, Sen. Patrick", Leahy, up to now a MS supporter.            The national conversation on sexual harassment gets curiouser and curiouser., "Now comes Abe Rosenthal, who responds to Gloria Steinems Times op-ed", from earlier in the week with one of his own. Steinem had argued that if anuninvited sexual gesture by a man is met with noncompliance by a woman and thenis not followed up by him, no sexual harassment has occurred. Rosenthalcounters with a family secret. Many years ago, his older sister was walking inthe park when a man exposed himself to her. She screamed and ran home, whereshe came down with a cold and then pneumonia and then a few days later, died., "Rosenthals counter to Steinem is that mere uninvited sexual gestures can", be...fatal. This is a sad, sad story, but legally and morally irrelevant. Tothink otherwise is to opt for making coming up behind someone and saying "Boo"a crime, because yes, it just might possibly scare him to death.                                       , "            Hellos Special", , "            Whats so special about special prosecutors these days?

The Washington Post goes with the revelation that U.N. weapons", inspectors have uncovered evidence that in 1995 Russia had agreed to sell Iraqsophisticated equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons. This, "disclosure, says the WP , puts a new spin on Russias recent diplomatic", efforts to modify the inspection procedures applying to Iraq: perhaps they aredesigned, not to head off a war, but to keep such mass destruction fingerprintsfrom being lifted.            Our grandchildren may look back at this as the year when the branch of theCabinet known as Special Prosecutions started on its way to becoming thelargest single entity in the federal government (Motto: "The Purpose ofGovernment is to Investigate Government"). USAT and the NYT (in, "its front-page piece) note this is Renos fourth request for a special", prosecutor looking into a Clinton Cabinet officer and the Times adds, "its the sixth one appointed overall during the Clinton administration. The", Times goes on to observe that this is the first Clinton-era outside, "inquiry into political fund-raising. (Youll recall Reno declined to go the", special prosecutor route over Clinton-Gore coffees and phone calls.)            The papers all emphasize, however, that Reno\s request is "very narrow inscope" (the NYT \s words). And the LAT says any subsequentbroadening of this mandate would be "unusual." Hmmm.perhaps someone shouldcheck this with that key figure in 1970s Arkansas real estate deals, MonicaLewinsky., "            Starrs move on the Secret Service raises novel arguments. Agents have", testified before (most famously about the Watergate taping system), but neverabout what they saw or heard the president do. As a WP editorial points, "out, the agents are law enforcement officers and so shouldnt be any more", silent about illegal activities than say, an Arkansas state trooper. But on theother hand, the NYT points out that the Secret Service argues that if apresident physically distances himself from his protective detail out of fearsfor his confidentiality, security is compromised., "            More Monica news: Marcia Lewis second day of grand jury testimony ended", abruptly, says the NYT , when she became physically and emotionally, "unable to continue. Shes expected back today. Her daughter will nestle into", that pre-warmed hot seat early next week.            The USAT front carries word that the EPA is considering requiringlocal water systems to issue reports on the chemical contents of their water toconsumers. The story also makes the LAT and WP , which reportsthat the FDA is considering requiring similar labeling on bottled water. This, "is key: without the ability to know whats in tap water alternatives, knowing", "whats in tap water isnt worth much.",             A Wall Street Journal "Politics and Policy" piece onthe post-affirmative action drive to do away with SATs as a college admissionstool reports that after the Texas legislature passed a law that in effectreplaced SAT scores with high school class rank, Texas A & M Universityfound that some high schools are reporting that 25 percent of their studentsare in the top 10 percent of the class.            A letter to the editor in the NYT points out there wassomething odd in the recent Times charge in an editorial that President, "Clinton cant prove his sweeping assertion that Kenneth Starr has illegally", leaked grand jury testimony. The writer notes that the Times could helpin this regard, since it has run stories apparently benefiting from leakedinformation relating to grand jury testimony. But although the topic is, "important enough for a NYT editorial, dont look for any Times", news stories to really dig into such leaks, as they are the lifeblood of the, "papers scandal coverage.",             Readers are asked at this point to observe a moment of silence. After, "yesterdays nee-saying debacle, TPs eighth-grade French teacher, Mme. Teller,", hung herself.                                                   Saddam But True            The New York Timesleads with a story nobody else is paying much attention to right now--thecontinued Iraqi failure to provide U.N. weapons inspectors with adequate, "information. USA Hello leads with Ken Starrs and Paula Jones decisions", to press on. The Washington Post goes with a story that the NYT got out infront on yesterday: the death of Pol Pot. The Los AngelesTimes leads with news that must strike terror deep within the hearts of, "its readership: the states second largest phone company, GTE, mistakenly", leased tens of thousands of unlisted phone numbers to telemarketers.            The Times lead is spurred by the latest report from the U.N.chief arms inspector to Kofi Annan concluding that Iraq is no closer now tomeeting U.N. requirements for the lifting of sanctions than it was last fall,when Saddam Hussein went to the brink to prevent further arms inspections. The, "paper sees a further ominous sign in Thursdays new outburst of Iraqi", defiance--a call by the highest levels of the Iraqi government for theimmediate lifting of all embargoes.            The NYT has some choice tidbits from that as-yet unpublished U.N.report (and from others as well). Apparently, inspectors found some of thebuildings on their list to have been stripped of all equipment and evenfurniture. Indeed, none of the sites visited outside of Baghdad had eitherdocuments or computers. And some inspectors were stunned by the opulence of thepresidential palaces. Some rooms in them must have, according to some on theU.N. team, cost millions of dollars to furnish.            The Post reports that Pol Pot died quietly on a flowered mattress. The story goes, "on to describe televised footage of the death scene: Pots body stretched out", on a bed, plastic sandals at his bedside. Or you could turn to the NYTtop front, which has a large color shot of just this scene. The WPquotes journalist Nate Thayer, who recently did the first interview with Pot in18 years, saying he had no doubt that the man on the mattress was Pol Pot anddead., "            The emotional scars left by Pol Pots terror reign are crystallized in a", remark made by a "Killing Fields" survivor, quoted by both the WP andNYT : "If he\s dead, hand over his body to the people....I want to seehim handcuffed and pushed into a jail, like his cadres did to me 20 yearsago."            Both the Post and Times note that the U.S. is taking the, "position that Pol Pots death should not end efforts to bring to justice other", Khmer Rouge leaders implicated in the Cambodian slaughter. The WP lead, "editorial states that eight to ten members of Pots extermination committee are", still at large, and the NYT lead editorial says that the current head ofCambodia, Hun Sen, is also a henchmen., "            The WP reports that the Republican National Committees reaction to", Al Gore\s disclosure of his tax return the other day was to label him "VicePresident Scrooge" for donating just [[$35]3 ]to charity last year out of his incomeof [[[$1]]97,729].            The Wall Street Journal reports that in the months leading upto recent Judiciary Committee hearings on Microsoft, the Senate Democratscampaign organization was given [[[$20]0]],000 worth of free software by competitorOracle.            The NYT picks up today on a story first reported by the SouthChina Morning Post : Apple Computer, in bringing to Hong Kong its "ThinkDifferent" ads featuring pictures of famous independent movers and shakers, has, "decided to drop the Dalai Lamas portrait from the campaign. The", "company at first tried to claim that this was because the Tibetan leaders face", is not well-known in the region--until confronted with the information thatpolls show 80 percent of Hong Kong residents are familiar with him. Now theline is, "In China, he may not get across the message that Apple is trying tosend." True, since apparently the message is money-grubbing phonyindividualism.            The NYT and LAT fronts report that a Vanderbilt Universitystudy, to be published today in Science , indicates that blacks are far less likely than whites to make use of theInternet. The racial divide is particularly pronounced on the lower end ofthe economic scale. Among households making less than [[$40,000 ]]a year, whiteswere six times as likely as blacks to have used the Web. By the way, theLAT story cannot just refer to the "World Wide Web"--oh no, it has toexplain that this is "a popular Internet graphical network, encompassing some62 million Americans, that is revolutionizing business and education." Now, "think about this--if a reader doesnt know what the Web is, would he know what", the Internet is, or what a graphical network is?                                                   Bank Shots            The Washington Post and Los Angeles, "Times lead with Mondays big merger announcements, and everybody has", lots of front-page and inside banking stories. The New York Times ,which led with the mergers yesterday, goes with the looming high costs of themidterm elections. USA Hello goes with the mysterious breakdown experienced byAT&T\s "frame relay" data network, which is used by hundreds ofmultinational companies to handle such tasks as central database access ande-mail. The main effects the paper mentions are a reservations slowdown at, "Northwest Airlines and travel agencies difficulties getting credit card", authorizations.            The WP lead reports that the company emerging from theBankAmerica/NationsBank combine will command eight percent of all bank depositsin the U.S., close to the ten percent limit currently mandated by federal law., "The Post notes however, that unlike last weeks Citicorp/Travelers move,", which challenges Depression-era laws barring different types of financialservices from being offered by a single company, this bank merger is within theboundaries of current law, because in 1994, Congress allowed coast-to-coastbanking. But, mentions the Wall Street Journal , Sen. Arlen Specter is contemplatinglegislation that would raise the hurdles to Fed approval of big bankmergers.            The WP reports that many bank stocks soared on the merger news, whilethe LAT identified more with customers and employees than shareholders,going high in its story with concerns that the BankAmerica/NationsBank dealwould lead to higher fees and could eliminate 8,000 jobs. The NYT, "doesnt get to that latter bit of unpleasantness until the fifteenth paragraph", of its bank story.            The WP breaks out a separate story about what the deal means to customers, dominated by wiggle-claimsquoted from others like "bigger is not necessarily better when it comes to theaccounts of individual customers" and "bigger banks do tend to charge higherfees." But USAT \s news section cover story on bank mergers says itflat-out: "surveys show that big banks charge higher fees," and backs thatassertion up with several data bullets.            A NYT op-ed makes the point that in light of these big bankmergers, the government should reconsider the consequences if one of the newmonsters fails. Current law allows the government to completely protectdepositors and creditors of banks considered too big to let fail. This policyignores the lesson of the S and L crisis in the 1980s and of the current Asianimbroglio: the promise of complete protection contributes to bank failures byencouraging risky bank ventures. So, the piece argues, big account holdersshould have to personally bear some of the loss that comes from a failure. Thatwould encourage them to monitor their banks more closely.            The NYT lead says that the upcoming midterm elections are aptto break spending records because candidates are buying television time far, "earlier than ever before. The trend is being attributed to Bill Clintons 1995", decision to mount an early and intense television campaign. Another influencethe paper cites is that of Steve Forbes, who became a major force in early, "Republican primaries by spending tons of his own money on TV ads. Its become", obvious that politicians fear not having the campaign money far more than theyfear any scandal caused by raising it. The paper notes that Alfred Checchi, acandidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of California, beganbuying television ads just before last Thanksgiving for the primary vote this, "coming June. Checchis standard, says the Times , promises to lead to the", most expensive state election in history.            The WSJ "Work Week" column notes a simple position taken by theNational Association of Manufacturers that could encourage high school studentsto take their classes more seriously: use high-school transcripts more inhiring.            The WP business section reports that a company that until now hassold its language-understanding software to the intelligence community forspy-detection is poised to sell a similar product designed to help thegovernment and brokerage firms monitor the offers and promises made by brokersin communications with (potential) clients. The idea is that the program thatonce could pick out the needle of a phrase like "covert operative" in ahaystack of e-mails has now been trained, says the paper, to do the same for"opportunity of a lifetime" and "so safe even my mother has it." Forgive"Hello\s Papers" for wondering--but how will this software catch brokers if it, "couldnt catch Aldrich Ames?",                                                    Lewinsky Outsky            The New York Times ,Washington Post , and Los AngelesTimes lead with the decision by the judge in the Paula Jones lawsuit toexclude all evidence relating to Monica Lewinsky. USA Hello, "goes with the apparently floundering negotiations between Lewinskys lawyers", and Kenneth Starr. All four fronts are adorned with a fresh picture of Ms.Lewinsky, appearing far more sophisticated than in the previous head shot orthe CNN reel. No doubt about it, sitting chiaroscuro in the back of a limo nextto a criminal defense attorney is a good look., "            The Jones case ruling came, explain the papers, in response to Starrs even", "broader request to halt all of the cases fact-finding in deference to Starrs", criminal investigation. The judge acknowledged that Lewinsky-related evidence, "might be relevant, but says its not essential. Jones lawyers were", disappointed, being left in the position, observes the NYT , of not being, "able to use evidence their case helped flush out. President Clintons suits", liked the decision. "That\s huge," said Robert Bennett in the WP . "That, "means we try the Paula Jones case and not the Monica Lewinsky case. Thats", huge, man." (The NYT has the same quote, but loses the "man.")            Pace Hillary Clinton, the NYT points out that this legal conflict, "between the Starr and Jones camps shows that theres not a united anti-Clinton", front.            The LAT lead cites experts who argue that the decision has a bigpro-Clinton upshot: if the sworn statements Clinton and Lewinsky recently gave, "to Jones lawyers are not admissible, then they cannot be used as the basis for", "perjury or obstruction of justice charges. The LAT notes that Starrs", "office doesnt agree.",             The NYT story on the Lewinsky/Starr negotiations hasplenty of goodies. Such as: Tripp saying Thursday night that she was presentlate one night when Clinton called Lewinsky, and that she had seen "numerousgifts" the two exchanged. The story also states that FBI agents removed several, "dresses and pant suits from Lewinskys Watergate closet and that the FBI", laboratory has tested them to see if they could be linked to Clinton. The paper, "does not know the tests outcome.",             The WP , NYT , and USAT go front-page with the bombingyesterday at an Alabama abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officerworking there as a security guard. Operation Rescue reps joined pro-choiceadvocates in condemning the action. Investigators are looking to see if thecrime has any connection to two unsolved 1997 Atlanta clinic bombings.            The Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" reminds us that, "journalists can dish it out but they cant take it, with its report that Sidney", Blumenthal, who is suing Matt Drudge for slander, has, via his lawyers, blastedNBC\s Tim Russert for having Drudge on "Meet The Press" last weekend.            The WP off-lead reports that the French foreign minister isunexpectedly firm in his support of U.S. threats against Iraq. The new Frenchstance is also Page One at the LAT . Meanwhile, fully half of theNYT op-ed page is given over to calls for action against Saddam. WilliamKristol and Robert Kagan say that the U.S. should remove Hussein and his regimefrom power. A.M. Rosenthal goes that one better: "Eventually he will have to bekilled for the safety of his own people and of the Middle East."            The NYT reports that the Manhattan Deli added two sandwiches to itsmenu Thursday: The "Bill Clinton" and the "Ken Starr." And on the first day atleast, the former outsold the latter. The sandwiches are identical concoctionsof ham, baloney, and turkey. With one difference: The "Clinton" uh, comes witha tomato.                                                   The Kuwaiting Game                           USAHello leads with the U.S. decision to move 3,000 additional troops into, "Kuwait as part of its Iraq build-up. The Washington Post leads with a GOP Senate reports criticism", "of Al Gores apparent fund-raising appearance at a Buddhist temple during the", "96 campaign. The New York Times", "goes with Monica Lewinskys upcoming compelled appearance before a Washington", D.C. grand jury. And the Los Angeles Times leads with INS mistakes that mayhave led to improper naturalized citizenship of more than six thousandimmigrants.                           USAT says the purpose of the fresh troops is to increase pressure on, "Saddam Hussein, but also collaterally raises the question of how exactly thats", supposed to work, since the paper also states there is no intention to usethose soldiers or those already in Kuwait for "offensive action" against Iraq.That will be done, says USAT , from the air. (Just a hunch, but look for, "an opening move thats more commandoey than what Saddams reading about in the", U.S. dailies. Very possibly one that will achieve the same results as anassassination without itself being banned by U.S. policy because the operation, "wasnt designed to be one--wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) USAT s lead", includes a quote from a fighter pilot that nicely distills G.I. geopolitics:"We\re all a little itchy. We\d kind of like to do something.\\            The troop move is in the front-page news box at the Wall Street Journal , on the WP and LATfronts, and inside at the NYT .            The WP lead, concerning the report by Senate Republicans, "on Al Gores participation at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser, is in the same", "mold as last Sundays NYT lead--a summary of facts already unearthed", "during the Thompson hearings, with nothing really new. The Post s", "adjacent piece suggests that the reports finding concerning alleged", connections between Clinton money operatives and Chinese intelligence officialsis in the same limbo. A similar bit of warmed-over material--about an audiencewith Clinton apparently granted in exchange for a [$325,000 ]campaigncontribution--graces the LAT front., "            The NYT explains that now that Monica Lewinskys negotiations with", "Kenneth Starr seem to have stalled out, she has been summoned to appear before Starrs D.C. grand jury on Thursday. The", paper calls the move "a significant escalation."            In discussing how when word leaked about Lewinsky, it put an end to anyundercover usefulness she might have had, the NYT writes, "The next day,word of her alleged affair with the president began seeping out on an Internetgossip site.." The Times , in other words, still can\t bear to breathethe words "Matt Drudge" as a source of news. This is as absurd and snobbish asif NBC News were to report on a story that originally was broken by a"newspaper with offices on 43rd St.", "            The NYT s Keith Bradsher has pretty much owned the topic of the", dangers presented to normal-sized cars by sports utility vehicles, and todayBradsher continues, writing about an auto insurance industry report that urges auto makers toredesign SUVs because they "increase the risk of death for other road userswhile providing little if any additional protection for their own occupants."The WSJ sees things pretty much the same way, going high, "with the reports claim that people in cars hit broadside by SUVs are 27 times", more likely to die as the SUVs occupants. But the WP in its SUV piece says the report is more nuanced,suggesting that the problem lies not just with the size of the SUVs but alsowith the lack of protective features in small cars.            On the top of the NYT national edition is a picture of Secretary of, "Defense William Cohen on the ground in Kuwait that is interesting because its", the rare shot of an American politician doing something the rest of us do allthe time: wear sunglasses. The picture helps drive home the basis for thetaboo: Behind those Foster Grants Cohen looks every bit the kind of oleaginouspol the Godfather has to eventually help out of some little unpleasantness inVegas.            The WP runs a story on its front about the recent discovery that amuch-ticketed truck-driver "whose license was revoked after a crash in Augustkilled a teenage motorist...." was caught driving again. And atop the storysits the headline: "Driver of Truck That Killed Teen is Cited with NewViolation." Besides having previously received thirty-two traffic citations,the driver precipitated the fatality by running a red light. So, it may seem alittle thing, but imbued with the Orwellian desire to combat imprecise languagethat makes lies sound truthful and murder respectable, "Hello\s Papers" wouldurge the WP to rewrite such stories thus: "...whose license was revokedafter he crashed into a car, killing a teenage motorist...." And to put itunder a headline like: "Driver of Truck Who Killed Teen is Cited With NewViolation."                                                   Kofi Break?, "            The late Sunday movement in the Iraq crisis is everybodys lead. USA Hello", says that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will arrive in New York today fromBaghdad, bringing with him an agreement that may avert a second Gulf War. TheLosAngeles Times reports the breakthrough came via a dramatic, three-hourbargaining session between Annan and Saddam Hussein. The Washington Post says Annan will present the document he andHussein already signed Monday (Baghdad time) to the Security Council in NewYork on Tuesday. Written details were not available at press time (and, "USAT notes that U.S. officials arent sure that Annan could speak", frankly about it to anyone while he remained in Iraq where phone lines are notsecure), but the dailies are reporting that Hussein has agreed to open hispresidential palaces to U.N. weapons inspectors--the sticking point that hasbrought the U.S. to the brink of warfare. More than the other papers, theNew York Timesemphasizes that much seems to remain unresolved for the moment--the number ofsites covered may actually be limited, it reports.            According to the coverage, the newly brokered agreement lacks something theIraqis had previously insisted on--a time limit on inspections of thepresidential locations. And in return, the U.N. agrees to provide diplomatsfrom various countries who would accompany the weapons inspectors. Even if theSecurity Council approves the deal, notes the WP , Washington hasreserved the right to bomb Iraq. And White House spokesman Mike McCurry iswidely quoted as noncommittal. But, says the Post , Annan is confidentthat all members of the Council, including the U.S., will accept the deal. Oneadministration concern the Post passes along: that Annan may not haveinsisted on the right of inspectors to make repeat visits to the presidentialpalaces.            The NYT emphasizes that the agreement apparently does not address the, "issue of other presidential properties not on Baghdads list of eight. The", Times national edition reports that "some diplomats say" that in only amatter of weeks inspectors could run into access problems at other sites. TheNYT metro edition is bolder: "The agreementapparently does not address the issue of other presidential properties notamong the eight listed by Baghdad." The USAT frontsection cover story">USAT front section cover story is plainerstill: "The problem is that over the years, Saddam has also agreed to manythings on which he has not followed through."                           USAT goes front-page with the news from Sunday morning chat show, "appearances made by Monica Lewinskys attorney, William Ginsburg, that she", "absolutely" stands by her affidavit in which she denied having sex withPresident Clinton. Only USAT sees this as big news. The other frontspass, perhaps because, as USAT notes, Ginsburg has said almost as muchbefore.            The Wall Street Journal waited until the day after Desert Stormopened fire to run its profile of Norman Schwarzkopf. Hello, it does a littlebetter in running an interesting Thomas Ricks profile of the current Iraqioperation\s top dog, Gen. Anthony Zinni. It seems to "Hello\s Papers" that suchmen should get at least as much advance press attention as second-tierpresidential candidates do. (How many column inches, for instance, did theJournal spill on Alan Keyes?) The piece has the good detail that whenZinni headed up peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, he met regularly with localcartoonists, who he discovered, had inordinate influence on the largely, "illiterate local populace. The pieces only real false-step: describing the", Marine Corps\ ideal officer as a "knuckle-dragging intellectual." Would theJournal ever call a CEO that?, "            A front-page NYT piece notes the trend towards Internet-aided prostitution operations. TP doesnt know the", NYT policy regarding the giving of Web addresses in news stories, butnotes that in this one, the address for a Chelsea-based sex serviceclearinghouse called "Redlightnet.com" is not issued. But what\s the point ofwithholding this, since a Web search of that handle will quickly turn up aURL?                                                   Anti-Pap, Anti-Iraq                           USAHello leads with mounting criticism of Kenneth Starr, mincing no wordsin referring to "his probe into President Clinton\s sex life." The Washington Post leads with the rise in doctors\ disability, "insurance claims. The Los Angeles Times goes with the Clinton administrations", desire to drop the annual process of certifying that Mexico and other nationsare cooperating in the drug war in favor of setting up an internationalanti-drug alliance that such countries would join. The New York Timeslead states that the "consumer" health-care laws (the scare-quotes are suppliedby the Times ) being discussed in state capitals tend to focus more onprotecting "the incomes, jobs and turf of the health-care system\s biggest andrichest vested interests," namely, specialist physicians and managed-careplans.            Doctors used to be among the most dependable workers in America, but, "according to the WP , theyve been leaving their jobs to collect disability benefits in such high numbers that", insurers now view them as in the same claim risk echelon as grocery cashiersand bank tellers, and even riskier than shipping clerks and traveling salesmen.Not to mention far below lawyers, accountants and engineers. The most likelyexplanation: stress and unhappiness brought on by the widespread advent ofmanaged care. As a result, disability premiums for docs are up big-time: onebig insurer is charging nearly 25 percent more than just last summer.                           USAT \s off-lead states that "the Clinton administration began makingthe case for military action against Iraq to a U.S. audience Sunday.." That"began" is a little unfair, isn\t it? The paper goes on to point out that, "Congress, which began a weeks recess Friday, left without passing a resolution", "authorizing force. Isnt this a rather telling demonstration of Congress", priorities? Hmmm...what should I do: Decide on whether or not to go to waror...take a vacation?                        The NYT front discusses some of the events that could affect thetiming of any military action against Iraq. Chief among them: moon, "phases (stealth aircraft are easier to eyeball under a full moon), Parents", Weekend at Stanford (President Clinton and Hillary are scheduled to go, and, "thats not the best place to conduct a war from), and the Olympics (theres an", international convention that nations refrain from war during the Games).                           USAT reports that, as part of his pitch on a Sunday "This Week" shot,Secretary of Defense Cohen showed a photo of a Kurdish woman and child killedby Iraqi chemical weapons. Yet a front-page piece by LAT Middle Eastexpert Robin Wright states that in the eyes of some U.S. intelligence experts,the U.S. knew the intelligence it supplied to Iraq in the 80s (during its warwith Iran) would be used to develop chemical weapons plans.            The LAT front also brings word of anti-paparazzi legislation about to be introduced by Sen. DianneFeinstein. The "Personal Privacy Protection Act" (it sounded better than the"Alec Baldwin Should Be Able To Punch Out Photographers" Act) would, says thepaper, preserve the right to photograph celebrities in public, but would crackdown on actions that could jeopardize safety. This is a fine example of whatSlate deputy editor Jack Shafer has called a therapeutic law: itaccomplishes nothing, except perhaps to make us feel good via the illusion ofaccomplishing something. Really, how many examples are there of paparazziendangering (as opposed to merely inconveniencing) celebrities? Princess, "Dis death turned out not to be one--it was drunk driving. The LAT lead", "mentions a mob of photographers outside Monicas house waiting for a glimpse,", "but again, wheres the safety issue there? The paper also mentions Arnold", Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver being cut off in traffic by videographers, butthat just gets at the redundancy of the law: reckless driving is alreadyagainst the law, as is trespassing on somebody\s doorstep. "Hello\s Papers"suspects that Sen. Feinstein gets all this, but can also do the math: a billprotecting the rights of Arnold and Alec means serious donations., "            Saddams complaint that has led to the current impasse is that the U.N.", "weapons inspectors are U.S. spies. And yet on the WP s front, R. Jeffrey", Smith makes the point that if U.S. military planners do attack Iraq, they willbe drawing in part on data about Iraqi capabilities and targets collected by the U.N. teams.            On Sunday, the NYT used the Bill-Gates-pie-in-the-face incident as aspringboard for a "Week in Review" thumbsucker about the history of food as a, "weapon. It wasnt enough to have the de rigeur mention of James Cagney", grapefruiting Mae Clark. There were also references to the Peloponnesian war,the Irish Rebellion, Bismarck, and the siege of Leningrad. But most special,however, was this passage: "A pie in the face, it\s Soupy Sales stuff," saidAndrew Smith, who teaches culinary history at the New School for SocialResearch."                                                   Gone Fission            USAHello, the Washington Post, and the New York, "Times all lead with Indias surprise nuclear tests, which are also the", subject of a lengthy WSJ front-page leader. The Los Angeles Timesputs this development just above the fold, but leads with the California, "Supreme Courts ruling upholding the admissibility of DNA evidence, provided", prosecutors show that correct procedures were used.            The NYT and WP note that Indian Prime Minister Atal BihariVajpayee, who announced the tests yesterday, came to power two months ago asthe head of a Hindu nationalist party that has advocated the embrace of nuclearweaponry as a vehicle for achieving great-power status. The Timesreports that basically, within India the tests met with neither politicaldissent nor Gandhian pacifism.            Most everywhere else was different. The papers report that President Clintonwas "deeply distressed" (but, says USAT , he will still make his plannedtrip to India and Pakistan later this year). Japan, Australia and New Zealand, "condemned the tests, report the papers, and Japan--Indias largest foreign aid", source--and the U.S. are considering suspending aid to the country. Althoughthe amount of direct U.S. aid is minuscule, the Times and Journalexplain that the Clinton administration is considering invoking a 1994 federallaw that would, besides cutting off aid, also bar billions in American bankloans and World Bank and IMF aid. The NYT adds Britain and Germany tothe ranks of those not amused.            And there was Pakistan, whose Foreign Minister Ayub Khan responded, reportsthe NYT , by hinting that his country would consider conducting its ownnuclear tests. The papers all note the widespread fear that the tests couldsignify heightened tensions between India and Pakistan and even a nuclear armsrace between the two countries. Neither country, the papers note, has signedthe treaties that constrain nuclear tests. Most of the papers observe that manyIndians feel the tests were really designed to send a message to China,especially, as the Times , the WP , and the Journal report,since the Indian Defense Minister said just last week that China, not Pakistan,is India\s "potential enemy number one."            The Times nicely captures the bizarre scene of the Indianannouncement, in which Vajpayee ignored the likely geo-political shockwaves andspoke instead of measured yields and expected values and offered his warmcongratulations to the scientists and engineers responsible. The NYT andPost observe that one of the three tests was of a thermonuclear device.The Post reminds the reader that is a hydrogen bomb. The Timesand WP say that despite spy satellites, the Indian tests seemed to havecaught the U.S. and the other established members of the nuclear club bysurprise., "            Everybodys off-lead is Janet Renos decision to seek the appointment of an", independent counsel to investigate allegations that Labor Secretary Alexis Herman peddled influence and wasinvolved in an illegal campaign contribution scheme. This is the seventh timeReno has asked for an independent counsel. The NYT editorial page wishes, "Renos sensitivity to conflicts of interest and campaign fund-raising", improprieties extended to "the broader and more important matter of the 1996presidential fund-raising scandals." A Wall Street Journal editorial, "Democrats and Coverups," makes thesame point., "            The LAT front says theres a limit to how big these mega-mergers can", "get: [$250 billion]. Thats how much, the paper figures, it would cost for", "General Electric, the nations largest company, to buy Microsoft, the second", largest.            Buried fairly deep inside the metro edition of the NYT is a verybrief item reporting that a defense contractor was sentenced in a procurementcase. What did he do? He sold defective parts for the cable system used tocatch U.S. Navy planes as they land on aircraft carriers. When these cablesfail, aircrews plunge to watery graves and flight deck personnel quite, "literally get cut in half. What was the executives sentence? Three months in", federal prison (Club Fed, no doubt) and three months of house arrest. Do you, "think that punishment fits that crime? Another question: Its bad enough that", "the law tends to downplay these cases, but why dont the papers make more of", "being willing to kill service members to make a profit? Maybe its because", "theyre too into profit and not enough into service members.",             Incidentally that WSJ editorial "Democrats and Coverups" makes theslyest reference yet to the Monica problem. The piece is ostensibly aboutWhitewater and the Web Hubbell tapes and the House Democratic counteroffensivevs. Rep. Dan Burton. But it includes this: "Now, we don\t doubt that it\spossible to wave all this away as partisan tit for tat. Problem is, seriousDemocrats know that this scandal is about a lot more than tat."                                                   University Admitting Mistakes?            The LosAngeles Times and New York Times, "lead with the University of Californias disclosure that as a result of", "Proposition 209s mandate to abandon affirmative action in admissions, the new", freshman classes at its two most selective schools, Berkeley and UCLA, will, "have far fewer minority students than in the recent past. The Washington Post goes with the Supreme Courts decision", allowing states to ban the courtroom use of polygraph results. USA Helloleads with news that might be heartening for many users of the now withdrawndiet concoction Redux: a new study suggests that short-term use of the drug isnot associated with an increase in heart valve problems. But the paper goes on, "to note that the study was sponsored by Reduxs manufacturer and does not in", any case address the consequences of long-term use.            The University of California admissions situation is relayed mostfrantically at the LAT , which states that "the number of African Americansaccepted by UC Berkeley has plunged 66% and the number admitted to UCLA dropped43%," without stating most of the raw numbers behind the percentages. (A commonjournalistic mistake/trick.) The WP does use the raw numbers whenreporting on Berkeley, but unaccountably goes back to emphasizing percentageswhen discussing UCLA. The NYT also shies away from the actual numbers ofstudents involved, but at least emphasizes the before-and-after-209 minoritypercentages of the total admitted pool, an illuminating datum. Both theLAT and NYT report that the minority drop occurred despite the, "universitys decision to give extra consideration to poor applicants, thus", "proving that in California at least, class isnt race.",             One university official is quoted by the LAT as seeing in the shift, "the message that Californias secondary schools must improve, while the paper", has Prop. 209 architect Ward Connerly saying it means some of the burden foradmissions must be put back on black and Latino families and the students, "themselves. A more striking Connerly quote somehow doesnt make the cut at", either Times , but is in the WP and USAT : "These numbers, "will finally and conclusively put to rest the lie that weve heard for so long", from these campuses that race is only one factor in how they choosestudents..It\s the decisive factor." (The WP should have, by the way,changed the present tense in that last sentence to the past, which was clearly, "Connerlys meaning. USAT gets this right.)",             Some questions: Why does the NYT headline only mention the drop in, "black admissions and relegate the drop for Hispanics to the subhead? Why dont", any of the stories mention the graduation rates for blacks and Hispanicsat the two schools under the old regime?            The Wall Street Journal spills a lot of ink on tobacco, with, "pieces about trial lawyers pursuit of anti-tobacco cases, the attempt by the", anti-asbestos lobby to tap into any settlement deal, and the political spin onthe pending Senate bill. The "Capitol Journal" column paints a picture of abill in "deep peril," and of a sharply divided Senate besieged by an "enraged"tobacco industry. In the end, says the paper, it may fall to one man to bringorder out of this chaos--Bill Clinton.            Both the LAT and NYT go front-page with the news that aneleven-year-old girl, Emily Rosa, did research for a science fair two years ago as afourth-grader that is being published today in the prestigious Journal of theAmerican Medical Association. Her project was a refreshingly simple experimentthat showed "therapeutic touch" practitioners don\t have a special ability todetect an energy field around human bodies. One question: why does the NYT say she showed that the healers detected a humanhand they couldn\t see at a rate "no better than chance" would have predicted,when her results show they scored only 44 percent, which is 6 percentworse?                                                   IMF-up            Everybody leads with the worsening violence in Jakarta, Indonesia. TheNew YorkTimes and Washington Post top fronts feature a dramatic picture ofprotesters hauling away a man reportedly shot by police. The Los Angeles Timesfront goes with looters carrying their plunder by a blazing overturned car.President Suharto, who had been in Egypt, returned to the riot-riddled capitaland called out tanks and thousands of troops in an attempt to restore order andmaintain his 32-year control of the country.            With the riot toll now standing at 24 dead (most shot, some trapped inburning buildings), the U.S. warned Americans not to travel to Indonesia. TheLAT reports that up to 3,000 Americans are already in Jakarta, withabout 12,000 more in outlying areas. The WP and NYT both capturethe growing political nuance of the street-level situation with theirobservations that some army troops were greeted with applause by rioters, andthat the soldiers, unlike the cops, mingled with the crowds. The military mightjust, the papers make clear, tip the scales against Suharto.            Despite some strong descriptions of events, all the papers could have done abetter job of explaining them. USA Hello, for instance, waits until the twelfth paragraphof its fifteen paragraph story to inform the reader that the unrest was about, "rising prices caused by Suhartos introduction of new IMF-dictated austerity", measures. The WP holds that information until paragraph eighteen. TheNYT delays until paragraph seventeen mention of rising unemployment andeconomic-based resentment of Chinese Indonesians. The LAT gets thepoverty and anti-Chinese angles, however lightly, into its first twoparagraphs.            The Wall Street Journal reports that Indonesian students have reliedheavily on e-mail and cell phones to organize their protests. And although thephone companies deny it, says the paper, the protesters believe their cellcalls are sometimes blocked to obstruct their planning.            The NYT has a top-front exclusive: that Democratic Party fund-raiserJohnny Chung has provided federal investigators with their first solid linkbetween the Chinese government and questionable donations made to the DNCduring the last presidential campaign. According to the Times , Chung nowsays a large part of the nearly [[[[$1]]00],000 ]he gave to the DNC in the summer of1996 came from a Chinese woman aerospace executive/army officer whose father, "was at the time Chinas top military commander and a member of the Communist", Party leadership. At the time, notes the paper, President Clinton wasfacilitating the Chinese launch of American civilian communications satellites.A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, is quoted in the piece saying, "We had noknowledge about the source of Chung\s money...", "            Everybodys front runs the news that Microsoft yesterday made a surprise", last-minute move to avoid antitrust lawsuits by agreeing to delay its releaseof Windows 98 while it enters settlement talks with the government. The talks, "start today and the shipments are delayed until at least Monday. Its clear", "that government officials feel theyre in the drivers seat now: one tells the", Post , "We\re not going to be locked in the room to be shown babypictures of Bill Gates."            The WP and NYT fronts report on the deaths of nine, "Palestinians in West Bank protests marking Israels fiftieth anniversary.", Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians moving towards Jewish settlements.Two of the dead were 8-year-old boys.            The WP runs an AP story saying that Susan McDougal is prepared to, "testify at her obstruction of justice trial about Bill Clintons truthfulness", regarding Whitewater matters. The dispatch mentions that McDougal arrived ather plea appearance in a prison jumpsuit and handcuffs. Television footageshows that the cuffs were manacled to a belly chain as well. "Hello\s Papers"has never seen any reporting about why Ms. McDougal, neither a violent offendernor a documented flight risk, must be trussed about like this. Some papershould find out: Is this really be an inflexible policy, or is it blatantmessage-sending by Kenneth Starr?            The WP reports that the National Highway Traffic Safety, "Administrations stats for 1997 are in. Notable numbers: Drunken driving", deaths--16,520--fell to their lowest level in twenty years. The total number offatalities was 42,000, 65 fewer than in 1996. (Wonder how many years have had anumber of deaths ending in three zeros.) And 63 percent of those killed in carcrashes were not wearing seat belts.            Another AP item in the Post reports that at her weekly newsconference, Janet Reno admitted she has become so confused over the computersystem in her office that she has forsaken it for paper and pencil. "Hello\sPapers" is astounded that not one reporter in attendance ventured to ask if theAttorney General had tried installing a different browser.                                                   Case: Dissed Miss, "            The surprising dismissal of Paula Jones lawsuit leads all around, with the", LosAngeles Times and Washington Post going with full banner headlines. Federal, "judge Susan Webber Wright ruled that although Bill Clintons conduct may have", been "boorish and offensive," it was brief, and isolated and didn\t result in, "physical harm. Therefore, it wasnt, she concluded, under even the most", charitable reading of the record, a sexual assault or workplace harassment. TheNew York Timesnotes that Wright gave no credit to Jones\ claim of suffering "sexual aversion"as a result of her run-in with Clinton. The papers all note that the judgedismissed as irrelevant in a few sentences all the Jones allegations of a, "Clinton pattern of extramarital sex. Jones lawyers intend to appeal. Ken Starr", responded to the news by promising to soldier on. The ruling, he tells USA Hello ,"has no effect on our authority."            The WP makes the point that this is not obvious, observing that anyperjury or obstruction of justice charges against Clinton would be based on hisconduct in a now-dead case.            The reaction of the other principals is widely reported: Clinton asked if, "the unexpected good news was an April Fools joke. Jones got the news on her", car phone and pulled over and cried. The Post says officials at theWhite House and with the president in Africa maintained a "consciously subduedtone," but the LAT reports staff cheers and laughter, and the NYTfinds President Clinton walking around his Dakar, Senegal hotel suite with acigar in his mouth and a drum in his hands (to be replaced moments later with aguitar.)            The political impact is also generally viewed as pro-Clinton. HouseRepublicans, says the LAT , may now be wary of moving aggressivelyagainst Clinton. The NYT says it even stronger: "It is now politically inconceivable that Congress will considerimpeachment."            But, adds the NYT , despite the trial outcome, "the president and thepresidency appear to have been diminished in important and lasting ways." Afront-page WP piece says the Jones lawsuit "has had an indelible impacton the American political system and on other institutions in American life."And the LAT lead editorial sees the development as a "bittersweetvictory for the president." Perhaps, the editorial continues, "it is possibleto envision a time when Social Security reform and other urgent issues mightcapture the attention of the nation and be at the top of the congressionalagenda. When the debate over health care returns to the spotlight. When thedetails of the tobacco settlement become a matter of wide public discussion., "But...the worlds suspicions about his truthfulness in many things will dog his", place in history." The scandal, says the LAT has made the president seem"coated in slime."            A Wall Street Journal front-page feature reports thatthe rich have, somewhat surprisingly, not been able to shelter their incomefrom the higher taxes ushered in by George Bush (1990) and Bill Clinton (1993).Indeed, says the Journal , upper income tax revenues are a big reason thefederal deficit has vanished. Nowadays the top 5 percent of American familiesin earnings are paying about 32 percent of their income in taxes, compared toabout 26.7 percent ten years ago.            A piece inside the WP (about an article coming out today in thescientific journal Nature ) reports that a New York scientist, StuartNewman, has applied for a patent for a way of mixing human embryo cellswith those from a monkey, ape or other animal. His goal: to set off adebate about the morality of patenting life forms, which Newman is opposed to.Currently, explains the Post , patents are not allowed on human beings, "(based on the 13th Amendments proscription of slavery), but the issue of", hybrids is unsettled, because patent law has not addressed "how human" ananimal would have to be before it fell under the ban.                                                   Peace Annan?            The ongoing U.S. assessment of the U.N.-brokered Iraq deal leads at USAT andthe WP. The national edition of the NYT goes with a Senate vote that keepsalive a campaign fund-raising reform bill (the metro edition of theTimes goes with a state court decision that gives New York City theright to kick topless joints and sex shops out of Times Square). The LAT lead, "is El Nino rainstorms that have killed six in California, while the papers", off-lead is the news that Kenneth Starr will prosecute White House officials ifhe believes they have spread false information about his staff. The stance,says the paper, amounts to an escalation of the confrontation with the Clintonadministration to "frenetic proportions."                           USAT reports that the U.N. Security Council delayed voting on theIraq agreement after pressing Secretary-General Kofi Annan on several points.The big unresolved issues, says the paper: the role of the diplomats who would, "now accompany weapons inspectors on their rounds, the inspectors chain of", "command now, and whether or not the agreements nod to respecting Iraqi", sovereignty could interfere with inspections. The WP says the U.S. fearsthe new inspection organization will be more susceptible than its predecessorto outside political pressures. In response, says the Post , Annantelephoned President Clinton yesterday, reassuring him that inspections willremain controlled by technical experts.            The WP also reports that the U.S. wants the U.N. resolution toautomatically declare Iraq in breach of the agreement if it resumes itsobstructive ways. The WP runs the text of the deal signed by Annan andHussein, and the language is surprisingly clear. "Hello\s Papers" has hadapartment leases that were harder to follow--and longer.            The NYT front runs a nice piece of access journalism detailing howPresident Clinton, and his top national security aides, especially MadeleineAlbright, contributed to the ultimate details of the Annan/Hussein deal. At onepoint, apparently, Al Gore suggested that the administration considerdesignating Saddam a war criminal. According to the paper, Washington was far, "more actively involved in planning Annans approach than has been previously", acknowledged.            But the biggest NYT story is that President Clinton has decided tohave his closest aides cite executive privilege to keep from testifying to theStarr grand jury about internal White House discussions on the Monica L.matter. The notion could be put to a test before a federal judge as early asthis week., "            The WSJ reports that the Justice Department has decided to fight Starrs", efforts to obtain testimony from presidential bodyguards. The decision wasforged, says the Journal , after the Secret Service director, in arguingthat efficient protection requires agent proximity and hence agentconfidentiality, made a presentation at the DOJ that included a slow-motionvideotape of a Secret Service agent taking a bullet intended for Ronald Reaganin 1981.            Some editorial writers weigh in today on the escalating battle betweenClinton and Starr. The WP lead editorial says Starr "absurdly"subpoenaed White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, and assesses the White Housestrategy of "looking for dirt on prosecutors and trying to discreditstraightforward reporting of embarrassing facts" as "sleazy." The NYTlead editorial views Starr\s move on Blumenthal as "bone stupid" tactically andan "attack on press freedom and the unrestricted flow of information."            The NYT reports that "robust investment returns coupled with strongdonations to higher education have created a financial boom for Americancolleges and universities, 25 of which now have endowments of [[[$1]] ]billion ormore." The piece goes on to quote various breathless university officials abouthow the money is rolling in, but nowhere is the question raised as to why iffinancial times are so good, tuition has risen at a ferocious rate, oftenoutpacing even health care costs.            The NYT front includes a Gina Kolata piece describing the rapidlyescalating cost of donor eggs for various infertility procedures. One NewJersey clinic has just doubled payments to donors, offering [[[$5,000 ]]]for a, "months worth of eggs. The paper notes that sperm donors typically get less", than [[[$1]]00], but also describes in some detail how much less fun egg donorshave.                                                   Mergers and Inquisitions            The New York Timesleads with two new major financial company mergers, with the bigger of the twodeals also flagged by the Wall Street Journal in its front-page news box. TheWashington Post goes with the confusing picturepainted by the welfare statistics collected by the various states. The Los Angeles, "Times goes with the papers poll results indicating that nearly", "two-thirds of those queried support Californias ballot referendum item calling", "for an end to bilingual education in the states schools. USA Hello", leads with concerns that Protestant and Catholic extremists could derail last, "Fridays historic peace deal.",             BankAmerica Corp. has agreed to merge with NationsBank Corp. in a transaction valued at, "about [[[[$60 ]billion]]], creating, says the Times , the nations first", coast-to-coast bank, and the largest in terms of total branches and deposits.The second deal, the [$30 billion ]combination of Banc One Corp. with First, "Chicago NBD Corp., would create the countrys fifth-largest bank, which would", dominate the Midwest. The two mergers will, says the NYT , further raisethe standard for how big financial companies feel they need to be.            The WP lead asserts that eighteen months after federalwelfare reform, "it is becoming clear that the mass of data the governmentrequires states to collect is in such disarray that it is impossible todetermine whether the law is working." The paper says the feds can\t tell, "whether or not states are meeting the reform laws targets for gainfully", employing former welfare recipients. State officials respond that they arefinding the federal data requirements overwhelming. The four-part series onwelfare reform the NYT started yesterday also finds the data less thancrystal-clear (no thanks to NYC officials, who, the paper says, gradually, "stopped cooperating with its requests for information). Yesterdays series", kick-off says the paper found "scant evidence" that the reforms had moved a"significant number" of New Yorkers from welfare to full-time work. Hello\s installment finds more certainty about outcomes, notingthat many workfare recipients have become part of the NYC municipal workforce,picking up the slack created when Mayor Giuliani reduced the city payroll tenpercent.            The LAT poll finds that the end-bilingual-education measure was notopposed by any voter bloc--whether designated by age, income, gender,geography, or ethnic group. Even among Latino voters, there was 50 percent, "support. (The paper didnt mention that a front-page article reporting on an", earlier poll had found the level of Latino support then to be much higher.) The, "papers pollsters found that those surveyed were not that antecedently familiar", with the issue, which the LAT attributes to the low-level, thus far, oftelevision advertising about it.            The NYT front, in a piece by the man who broke Whitewater, Jeff Gerth, revealsthat a May 1997 Pentagon report, secret until now, concluded that scientistsfrom the aerospace firms Hughes and Loral Space and Communications had turnedover expertise to China that significantly improved the reliability of that, "countrys nuclear missiles. The piece is a thorough and fascinating history of", "the two companies development of their Chinese markets in recent years. That", report, says the Times , prompted a criminal investigation of the, "companies, which was undermined this year when Clinton approved Lorals export", "to China of information about guidance systems. Lorals chairman, the paper", notes with a straight face, was the largest personal donor to the DemocraticParty last year.            The WSJ editorial page revisits an argument for privatizing Social Security accounts thepaper has hit before--that doing so would give blacks and married working womena much better return on their contributions than these groups now enjoy. Blacksare disadvantaged because of their comparatively short life expectancies,married women workers because Social Security payouts are presently based, "solely on a households higher earners contributions. The latter point is also", made in a NYT op-ed., "            A top-of-the-page op-ed piece in yesterdays LAT responds to the", recent decision by the Department of Justice not to prosecute Mark Fuhrman forany crimes he committed while with the LAPD by calling for the publicdisclosure of all of Fuhrman\s police records. "The documents in his file,"explains the writer, "may spur a debate relating to how an officer can have afile containing numerous complaints of misconduct against minorities and stillbe promoted through the ranks." The proposal comes from a man with a provenpenchant for spurring debates--O.J. Simpson. "Hello\s Papers" says, fairenough, O.J., provided you disclose the private information from yourfiles that you have thus far suppressed. You know, like your liedetector test results.                                                   Wang Turn            The Washington Post leads with the arrival in the U.S. ofjust-exiled Chinese dissident Wang Dan. The Los AngelesTimes goes with the conclusion of the economic summit in Chile, wherethe U.S. and 33 other nations decided to go forward with plans to create afree-trade zone throughout the Americas by 2005. The leads with word that anall-time record two million-plus legal resident immigrants are still waiting tobecome U.S. citizens. The USA Hello , WP and New York Times, "top fronts feature powerful pictures from yesterdays Oklahoma City bombing", third anniversary memorial service. USAT goes with a "scathing" Carnegiefoundation report concluding that many undergraduates at research institutionsgraduate "without knowing how to think logically, write clearly or speakcoherently."            Dissident Wang, a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations inTiananmen Square crushed by Chinese Army tanks, landed in Detroit yesterdayafter his release from a Chinese jail. (The WP notes that previously, "released dissident Wei Jingsheng was also flown to Detroit, but doesnt explain", "the destination. The NYT does: its the terminus of the only direct", flight from Beijing to the eastern U.S.) Wang was promptly admitted to ahospital for tests. The NYT , in the course of its four Wang stories,notes that some 2,000 people remain imprisoned in China for the crime of"counterrevolution." The WP says Wang\s release was part of a "reporteddeal" between Beijing and Washington that clears the way for President, "Clintons visit to China in June. The LAT is more definite, saying the", release was "one of the last steps in an extensive package deal secretlynegotiated earlier this year" during a "clandestine mission to Beijing on theweekend of March 7-8 by three Clinton administration officials."            The NYT has a front-page piece on the information turned up by Ken, "Starr for the Arkansas grand jury he has had looking into Bill and Hillarys", Arkansas financial dealings. The piece, by Whitewater experts Jeff Gerth andStephen Labaton is mostly a useful summary of old news, but there is new groundbroken: the grand jury evidence includes 1) a document found last summer in a, "briefcase in Vince Fosters attic that impugns Hillary Clintons account of how", "she came to represent James McDougals Madison Savings and Loan, and 2) Bill", "Clintons testimony that after the initial NYT articles on Whitewater he", sent an associate to see McDougal: "And I might have asked him to, you know,, "talk to him and see if we could have no further damaging articles, but I dont", remember exactly what I said."            The Wall Street Journal \s "The Outlook" column zeroes in on theclosest thing to a storm cloud in the current economic forecast: the stunningerosion of lending standards. The column reports that last year banks raisedoutstanding credit by more than 8 percent, the fastest rate of increase in tenyears. And that more financial outfits loosened lending rules than raised them., "Whats more, outstanding home and auto loans to borrowers with lousy credit", "histories surpassed [[$300 billion] ]this year. Thats 33 percent higher than just", the year before. Not to mention, adds the Journal ,150-percent-of-home-equity loans and mortgage loans to homeowners already in, "foreclosure. Actually, theres another storm warning in the Journal : In", February, mostly because of the Asian economic collapse, the U.S. trade deficitreached [[[$1]]2 billion], up 4.2 percent from January. Worse, says the paper, ispredicted in the months ahead.            A rave review of Salon inside the WP reminds "Hello\s Papers", "of something wrong with last weeks NYT piece about the American", "Spectator s attempts to account for the Richard Scaife money it disbursed", "in pursuit of Arkansas dirt on Bill Clinton: it didnt mention that this Scaife", funding effort was first reported on by The New York Observer andSalon .            A Philip Shenon piece in Sunday\s NYT "Week in Review", "makes an incredibly important point: Pol Pot wasnt the last big war criminal", "walking around free. Theres Idi Amin, estimated to have killed 300,000 of his", "fellow Ugandans, enjoying life in Saudi Arabia. Theres Bosnian Serbs Radovan", Karadzic and Ratko Mladic--Shenon reports that last summer the latter had anice holiday that took him from the Adriatic to the Danube and that he oftentravels along roads supposedly patrolled by NATO troops. And how about EmmanuelConstant, accused of complicity in the murder and torture of thousands ofHaitians in the early 1990s? Or General Jose Guillermo Garcia, accused ofcovering up the rape and murder of four American churchwomen in San Salvador in, "1980? Theyre both living in...the U.S.",             A column by Mike Downey in the Sunday LAT brought word of aninvention that could single-handedly reverse the tide of tabloidism: aminiature device worn on a cap or as jewelry that, whenever a photographer, "tries to take the wearers picture, emits a picture-ruining flash.",             The Sunday LAT also featured an interview with Bernard Lewinsky, whohad this to say in defense of his daughter: "She\s a very smart, intelligent,, "beautiful girl whos going to go places, and unfortunately shes taking her", licks...." "Thanks, Dad!"                                                               Nelvis Enters the Building, "            Kenneth Starrs latest moves lead at USA Hello ,", the Washington Post , and the New York Times .They are also the subject of a somewhat historic story at the Wall Street Journal . The Los AngelesTimes leads with the latest developments in the Iraq situation.                           USAT reports that on Wednesday Starr rejected a writtentestimony-for-immunity offer from Monica Lewinsky. Before a deal can bereached, the paper says, Starr wants Lewinsky to submit to questioning by hisinvestigators, who especially want to clarify whether or not there were anyattempts to cover up an affair with the president. Starr particularly wants tofind out more about what Lewinsky knows about the provenance of the "talkingpoints" memo that Linda Tripp apparently received from her. The WP leadalso says these are the main areas about which Starr wants more info., "            The LAT front doesnt cover the latest Lewinsky blips, but the other", "dailies are all over the parade of witnesses to Starrs Washington, D.C. grand", "jury. (The WP points out that Starrs rejection of Lewinskys offer may", "reflect his confidence in what hes getting from these witnesses.) Recent", testifiers include a Clinton friend who serves as his personal assistant, andthe chief steward at the White House, Bayani Nelvis., "            Last nights early editions of the on-line version of the WSJ broke the news that", "Nelvis told the grand jury hed seen President Clinton and Lewinsky alone", together in a study adjacent to the Oval Office. After the story went on-line,, "it was picked up by at least two TV networks and then denied by Nelvis", attorney. The Journal also reports that Nelvis says that he told Secret, "Service personnel that hed found and disposed of tissues with lipstick and", other stains on them following a meeting between Clinton and Lewinsky. Thepaper says Nelvis, on the White House staff for more than 15 years, relatedthis because he was personally offended.            The WSJ also reports that in their grand jury appearances, GeorgeStephanopoulos and Clinton personal secretary Betty Currie confirmed thatNelvis did have the access he claimed., "            The Journal s story represents a first because it was released on the", "papers web site, rather than being held for the hard-copy edition, and thus", "represents an occurrence youll be seeing again: newspapers and magazines using", their electronic versions to break and refine stories round-the-clock every bit, "as quickly as CNN. The WP s Howard Kurtz writes that the WSJ", "didnt wait for the morning paper because it was hearing footsteps from at", least one other news organization.            The NYT lead says Starr has rejected a White Houserequest that the questioning of senior Clinton aides be restricted. And inresponse, says the paper, the administration is prepared to invoke the sweepingprotection known as executive privilege as early as Thursday, when JohnPodesta, a deputy White House chief of staff, goes before the grand jury., "            The LAT reports that Boris Yeltsins warning that U.S. actions", against Saddam "could lead to a World War" took the White House by surprise.(This remark is also carried inside the WP and NYT .) The, "LAT says Yeltsins remark reflects the growing global anxiety about the", seeming inevitability of a U.S. attack. William Safire is less charitable,condemning Yeltsin harshly and painting his foreign minister Primakov as aformer spymaster and one-time ally of Hussein.            The NYT front reports that a split has emerged in Washingtonregarding any possible military response. Top Republicans are calling for theremoval of Saddam, while the administration is trying to suppressexpectations., "            The USAT front states that Italys defense minister is demanding", criminal prosecution for an American Marine pilot whose plane sliced through a, "ski gondolas cable Tuesday, killing all 20 passengers. The NYT , in its", front-page coverage, says the plane was flying far lower than the rules fortraining missions allow.            With crime down and the economy up, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani isfinally able to turn to the really big issues--like keeping the original Winnie-the-Pooh doll in a Manhattan museum against theclaims of a member of the British Parliament that it belongs back in England.Hizzoner is even planning a trip to the museum to, in the words of a likewiseunderworked spokeswoman, "reassure the bear that he is safe on Americansoil."                                                   Big Tools            The New York Timesnational edition leads with the battle for the control of Russia. The Washington Post leads with the conflict between PresidentClinton and Newt Gingrich over tobacco policy. USA Hello, "leads with the Supreme Courts ruling that even a white defendant can challenge", a grand jury indictment on the grounds that jury selection discriminated, "against blacks. The Los Angeles Times leads with the Senates rejection of a", White House proposal that would have provided [$3 billion ]for refurbishingcrumbling school buildings., "            On Friday, reports the Times , Russias legislature will hold its", third and decisive vote on whether to ratify Boris, "Yeltsins nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister. Yeltsin has vowed", to dissolve Parliament and hold national elections if the nomination is again, "rejected. Boris Berezovsky, reports the paper, one of Russias richest and most", ruthless businessmen and a former Yeltsin financial backer, has emerged as one, "of Yeltsin and Kiriyenkos biggest obstacles (Kiriyenko is also opposed by the", Communists). On Tuesday, Berezovsky used a newspaper he owns to openly tellYeltsin what he has to do to avoid a big fight over the nomination: abandonmarket reform., "            The Post lead is about the Democratic reaction to Gingrichs comment at a fund-raiser", Monday night that what\s happening with teen smoking has "nothing to do withJoe Camel." More important, he said, are smoke-glamorizing movies like"Titanic." Yesterday, reports the Post , Bill Clinton responded, saying,"Teen smoking has everything to do with Joe Camel, with unscrupulous marketingcampaigns that prey on the insecurities and dreams of our children." Thecontext for all this jockeying is the fate of the tobacco bill, with itsrestrictions on teen marketing, now awaiting consideration by the fullSenate.            The Post notes that Clinton and Gingrich have in the past lamentedthe tendency of Washington policy battles to become too personal, and thisstory is itself a perfect example of the problem. Although the remark by, "Clinton quoted above is the only one of his in the piece thats a direct", response to Gingrich, the headline reads, "Clinton Calls Gingrich a Tool of BigTobacco.", "            Theres real calumny in another Post story inside, which reports that", last week, Rep. Dan Burton, who has been heading up a House investigation intoClinton campaign finances, told the editorial board of the IndianapolisStar , "If I could prove 10 percent of what I believe happened, he\d[Clinton] be gone. This guy\s a scumbag. That\s why I\m after him." The storygoes on to note that Burton is planning to release tapes made by authorities of, "Webster Hubbells phone calls from prison. He is suggesting that the tapes", reveal incriminating conversations with White House officials. Federal law, "would prohibit such tape disclosures--except that it doesnt apply to", Congress.            , "               Damn, why didnt we think of that? The Wall Street Journal reports that China, worried that Avon,", Amway, Mary Kay and other direct marketers are building "ideologically chargedsales networks" headed up by "charismatic leaders," has issued an immediate banon door-to-door sales.            The WP front features a story raising an interesting issue relatingto the new male potency pill, Viagra. The pill is designed to correct impotence, butthere are already indications that huge numbers of men who are not impotent,but who simply want the sex drive of a 19-year-old, are eager to take it., "(Scientists dont know yet if it would have this effect.) If such a Viagra", Niagara materializes, insurance companies are likely to require, in order tocontain costs, medical proof of impotence for reimbursal. "Maybe some peoplewould rather have this than a Lexus," says one analyst. "But they should do itwith their own money."                                                   A Trie Falls                           USA, "Hello leads with Texas rare execution of a female prisoner. The", Washington Post lead is the surprise return to thiscountry and arrest of Clinton fund-raising figure Charlie Trie. The Los Angeles, "Times lead is the latest account of U.S. efforts to line up allies", support for a military operation against Iraq, while the New York Times, "lead covers the DODs broad description to Congress of what such an operation", might entail.            , "               USAT s description of Karla Faye Tucker sums up the emotionally", charged context perfectly: "pickax killer and born-again Christian." All thepapers quote Tucker\s last words to the families of her victims: "I am sosorry. I hope God will give you peace with this." The papers point out that thedeath by lethal injection came despite pleas for mercy from the Pope, PatRobertson and Jesse Jackson.            The NYT runs a sidebar on the mechanics of lethal injection. Good detail, but still no answer to, "the perennial question: Do they swab the prisoners arm with alcohol to prevent", infection before giving the needle or not? (If so, why?) But the piece doesreport that by one expert reckoning, 14 of the 287 lethal injection executionsperformed since 1982 have been botched. Like the time in Texas in 1988 when a, "tube leading into the condemned mans arm burst, spewing lethal fluids towards", the witnesses.            Both the NYT and WP front-page Tucker pieces capture the sceneoutside the prison walls. The WP notices some sympathetic signs but alsoone stating, "Forget Injection, Use a Pickax." Both papers note that a cheerwent up from the crowd when the deed was done.            Although all the coverage describes the last-minute legal maneuvering, noone explains how it was that this open-and-shut case took fifteen yearsto resolve.            The WP lead describes how Trie returned from Asia toDulles airport where he surrendered to FBI agents. He now faces a fifteen-countindictment--handed down just last week--alleging the funneling of illegal, "campaign funds to the 1996 Clinton-Gore ticket. According to his lawyer, Tries", return was voluntary, but the Post says no final understanding has beenreached about whether Trie will cooperate with the investigation.            The LAT says Madeleine Albright wrapped up her whirlwind tour of theMideast and Europe without winning a united mandate from U.S. allies to launchwhat could well be the most punishing military strike against Iraq since DesertStorm. The paper says the U.S. did, however, did win recognition from 10 alliesranging from Russia to Saudi Arabia that Hussein is behaving illegally and thathe must provide inspectors with unfettered, unconditional access to all sites.And Albright sees approval for the U.S. to do what it feels is necessary, evenif other countries may sit out the action. A WP inside piece says thatnone of the six Arab leaders Albright consulted with expressed outrightopposition to the use of force versus Iraq, and that several were considerablymore supportive in private.            The NYT lead sees "war fever" gripping Congress as it\s, "told by Defenses William Cohen that if diplomacy fails, the U.S. will wage a", "significant" military campaign against Iraq, which turns out to mean asustained air war, but no substantial number of ground troops. According to thepaper, this is commensurate with congressional thinking, which has little roomfor reprising the Gulf War. On the Hill they have the stomach to containSaddam, not to remove him.            The NYT also reports that the Clinton administration feels it alreadyhas in hand the justification for any new military strikes: the Congressionalresolution supporting hitting Iraq passed in 1991 on the eve of the GulfWar.            The Wall Street Journal runs a front-page feature showing thelatest corporate thinking on office romances. The piece points out that up tojust a few years ago, at most companies office relationships were grounds fordismissal, with the junior member of the couple typically getting the axe, butthat nowadays, such companies as IBM, AT&T, Corning and Xerox have moved tothe view that such relationships cannot be banned but can be managed. Usually, "by ensuring that neither romantic partner is in the others chain of command.", Such thinking has no doubt fostered an environment in which, reports theJournal , AT&T has 8,000 employees married to each other.                           USAT reports that while Monica is in Brentwood visiting her father, "(just down the street, apparently, from O.J.s old spread), her lawyers are", still negotiating with Ken Starr., "            The NYT s Frank Rich reminds us that the Lewinsky scandal isnt about", "the independent counsel law or media ethics. Its about sex. After all, Rich", "observes, even though 75 percent of the public tells pollsters theres too much", coverage of the scandal, that same public has made the porn business twice asbig as major-league baseball, three times the size of Disney World and eighttimes bigger than Broadway.                                                   Starr Dreck            "This is going to be the biggest story in my lifetime," is the way JamesCarville put it, and it leads everywhere, eclipsing such leaders-any-other-dayas the Pope celebrating Mass in Cuba, a surprise guilty plea in the Unabombercase, and the decision by Microsoft to give in on the issue of Windows95/Internet Explorer separation.                           USAHello says that while papering Washington and elsewhere with subpoenas,Kenneth Starr was working to persuade Monica Lewinsky to testify againstPresident Clinton. The paper says that the indefinite postponement of, "Lewinskys deposition--originally scheduled for today--in the Paula Jones case", was sought by her attorney while he negotiates with Starr. By contrast, theWashington Post says there appears to be littlemovement towards a Starr/Lewinsky deal that would protect her from prosecution, "for perjury and obstruction of justice, adding that her lawyer says he hasnt", heard from Starr since Monday. "Obviously," the Post quotes him, "ifthere\s jeopardy [to Lewinsky], I\d like a deal."            The New York Times, "coverage emphasizes yesterdays statement by Clinton friend and advisor Vernon", Jordan that "absolutely and unequivocally" Lewinsky told Jordan that there wasno affair. Jordan vigorously denied telling her to lie. Everybody also reports, "that Jordan admitted hed arranged some job interviews for Lewinsky. Readers,", especially those just out of college with hardly any prior work experience, are, "encouraged to contact Mr. Jordans Washington office for similar job placement", assistance.            The WP still leads the way in monomaniacal Monica-mania. Besides thefull front-page treatment, the Post strews inside such items as a report, "on Al Gores first statement about the scandal (he believes his boss), a", check-in with Gennifer Flowers, and a primer for parents whose children nowsuddenly ask, "Mommy, Daddy, what is adultery?"            The Times says the White House appears to have settled on a "strategyof denial and delay," which includes attempting to undermine Lewinsky\scredibility and raising questions about her motivation. The WP reports, "tension inside the White House between political advisors, who feel its", imperative for Clinton to quickly and forcefully rebut allegations, and thelawyers, who warn that Clinton should keep his public comments terse andundetailed until they can assemble more facts. The Post describesmeetings held yesterday between the two groups as marked by heated debate. Thepaper reports one explanation offered by the Clinton staff that shows the, "meeting rooms need better ventilation: Clintons comments during the 1992", "campaign could be squared with his apparent admission during last Saturdays", deposition that he\d had an affair with Gennifer Flowers because "Clinton wasonly denying the precise descriptions of the affair that Flowers had publiclyalleged--not that any sex between them had occurred."            The NYT , in an editorial slugged "Tell the Full Story, Mr. President," says thatthe statements offered thus far by Clinton and Jordan have compounded the, "cases oddities, not dissipated them.",                            USAT reports that those Starr subpoenaed yesterday include not justJordan but also the widow of former Arlington National Cemetery resident LarryLawrence. The NYT says the point of that is to ask her if she had anaffair with Clinton. Others the dailies list among the Starr-struck include, "Clintons personal secretary and a former Miss America. The NYT reports", "that FBI agents visited Linda Tripps literary agent Lucianne Goldberg in New", York and USAT has the detail that in 1972 Goldberg was paid [[[$1]],000 ]aweek by a high-level Nixon operative to spy on theMcGovern campaign.            Amidst all this, Jack Lord and his hair died. The obits fail to clear up anabiding mystery: Why did Kam Fong play "Chin Ho"? Why couldn\t he just be "KamFong"?                                                   Chrysler: Nothing Like a Daimler, "            The Daimler-Benz purchase of Chrysler (first hinted at in yesterdays", Wall Street Journal) leads at USA Hello, theNew YorkTimes, and the Los Angeles Times. The Washington Post goes with bipartisan congressional criticism of, "the Clinton administrations attempt to impose terms on Israel in its", negotiations with the Palestinians.            Daimler-Benz, the maker of Mercedes cars, will buy Chrysler for around [$35]billion, making, says USAT and the NYT , the all-stock purchasethe largest industrial merger in history. The NYT adds that it is alsothe largest-ever foreign acquisition of a U.S. company. Given current revenues,the deal will create the third largest car company, to be known asDaimler-Chrysler. The LAT gives a feel for the breadth of the new venture by noting that the top ofthe line Mercedes S600 sedan goes for [[[$1]]30,000 ]while the entry-level Dodge Neongoes for [[[$1]]2,000]. (The NYT says the Neon starts at [[[$1]]1,000 and ]the topMercedes is the CL600 coupe, which sells for [[[$1]]35,000].) The LAT says the, "deals motivations include Chrysler getting to expand its European sales, which", lag far behind Ford and GM, and Mercedes getting the chance to offerdown-market cars without tarnishing its snobby brand-name.            The papers see the deal as the beginning of a wave of consolidation in theauto business, brought on by excess manufacturing capacity. The WSJgives the lay of that land: Companies ready to go shopping include, besidesDaimler-Chrysler, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Honda. Likely acquisition targetsinclude Mitsubishi, Subaru, Hyundai, Kia, Renault, Peugeot, and even perhapsBMW., "            An expert in USAT s story foresees layoffs, driven by the elimination", "of duplicate departments. But, say the LAT and NYT, the merger shouldnt cause", major layoffs because the two car lines are so different. The NYT sticksto this even as it blithely notes that in recent years Daimler has gotten ridof more than 40,000 employees., "            Theres much talk in the merger stories of the challenges presented by the", different corporate cultures of the two companies. A perhaps more interestingdifference is not covered but could be teased out by an industrious reporter--a, "discussion of Daimlers activities under the Nazis, including any involvement", with slave labor., "            The WP and NYT go top-front with Rep. Dan Burtons apology to fellow Republicans for the", uproar caused by his selective release of Web Hubbell tapes. In the Washington, "manner, Burtons assumption of responsibility meant that someone else had to", "get fired--in this case it was Burtons chief staff investigator. The", Post reports that in a closed-door Republican House meeting, NewtGingrich referred to Burton\s investigation of President Clinton as a "circus."A lawmaker who was there tells the Post that Gingrich also told thegroup, "I want you to forget the word \scandals\ and start using the word\crimes.\"            , "               USAT s off-lead reports that at yesterdays presidential press", conference, the first questioner asked Bill Clinton to distinguish between hiscase and Richard Nixon\s use of executive privilege. Clinton said, "The factsare quite different in this case," but didn\t respond to any follow-ups. Thepaper efficiently sums up his position with its headline: "Clinton: I am notNixon."                                                   Whitewater Torture            The Whitewater indictment of Susan McDougal leads at USA Hello andthe Washington Post . The Unabomber life-plus sentenceimposed on Theodore Kacszynski leads at the New York Timesand Los, "Angeles Times . While McDougal is still front-page where it doesnt", "lead, the Unabomber doesnt make the front at the WP .",             McDougal was indicted for criminal contempt and obstruction by the ArkansasWhitewater grand jury for refusing to answer questions posed by Ken Starr.Having already completed an 18-month civil contempt sentence for refusing to, "answer Starrs questions and now serving time for her Whitewater fraud", conviction, she could get ten years if convicted on these new charges. The, "LAT says the move is an escalation of Starrs investigation. USAT", "says its his final effort to force McDougal to cooperate.",             The indictment contains some new information. At one point in the grand juryroom, McDougal said, "Mr. Starr should resign. That\s my only answer to you."And the evidence she was questioned about there but did not explain includes a[$5,081].82 check she made out in 1983 bearing the notation, "Payoff Clinton.", "(The NYT carries substantial excerpts from one of McDougals grand jury", appearances.), "            The Post quotes some legal experts saying its highly unusual to", prosecute someone for criminal contempt who has already served a civil sentencefor the same refusal to testify. (Small but important point: the USATstory never mentions that McDougal was granted immunity. But this is preciselywhat makes her silence indictable. The WP and the NYT get this right.)            The Unabomber sentencing proceedings included a statement from him as wellas remarks by victims and survivors of victims. The LAT says Kacszynskiwas "unrepentant" and "steely-eyed," and the victims "anguished." A widow\ssuggestion to the court makes everybody\s story: "Lock him so far down thatwhen he dies, he\ll be closer to hell.", "            If youre wondering what sort of service to look out for when NationsBank", completes its recently announced [[[[$60 ]billion]]] merger with BankAmerica to become, "the nations largest bank, take a gander at the WP front, which reports", that NationsBank, without admitting guilt (or denying any wrongdoing), agreed to pay [$6.75 million ]in fines to settle charges it soldhigh-risk investment funds as safe banking products, mostly to elderlycustomers who suffered significant losses. Three senior executives at the bank, "also received fines from [$35],000 to [[[$1]]00],000. The story doesnt say, but", "Hello\s Papers" guesses these fines don\t represent as much of a dent to thebankers as the uninsured losses did to the elderly investors. After all, theyonly amount to one-ten-thousandth of the value of the merged company.            The WP front reports that on the strength of news stories about tiny, "biotech firm EntreMeds promising cancer drugs, the companys stock price", quadrupled yesterday. In an inside piece, the NYT details thisdevelopment and a concomitant rise in the hope market as well.            The Wall Street Journal reports that about only about 5% of thefive million workplace drug tests administered last year by one major lab came, "out positive. Thats down from 5.8 % the year before and from 18.1 % in", 1987.            The NYT reports that a black U.S. Marine was severely beaten in broad daylight in a busyMoscow park by a band of Russian skinheads. Skinhead assaults have become sucha problem, reports the Times , that the American Embassy has twicealerted U.S. citizens, particularly those of African or Asian origin about thedanger of unprovoked attacks. Other embassies have done the same. Foreignstudent groups complain that Russian cops routinely fail to protect them. Thestory is carried inside, as it was in the LAT on Monday, and thequestion is, why? If a white Russian embassy guard was viciously assaulted byblack thugs in Washington, "Hello\s Papers" thinks it would be a page one storyeverywhere, in this country and beyond.                                                   The Soft Machine            The LosAngeles Times leads with the Senate passage of an education bill thatwould create a new tax break for parental school expenses. USA Hellogoes with the second alliance between major airlines in two days. The Washington Post has an investigation into the latestfinancial machinations of the Democratic National Committee. And the New York Timesleads with the biggest increase in the cost to employers of health careinsurance since the rise of managed care.            The Senate education bill, reports the LAT , is almost certain to drawa Clinton veto for such provisions as an IRA-style tax break for private andparochial school tuition, blocking national testing and allowing states tospend federal education funds virtually any way they choose. The story alsomakes the front at USAT and the NYT and is inside at theWP .                           USAT reports that United and Delta will announce a domestic, "partnership today on the heels of yesterdays decision by American and US", Airways to do the same. Continental and Northwest airlines announced a similarlink earlier this year, which, says the WP in its front-page story,sparks these actions by their competitors. These new links, explainsUSAT , while falling short of a merger, will mean accepting the frequentflier mileage earned by passengers of the other airline and letting them intoits airport clubs. More importantly, they could mean the consolidation offlight schedules, resulting in fewer and more expensive choices for consumersand fewer jobs for employees. The mileage and club arrangements do not requiregovernment approval, says the paper, but the schedule changes do.            The Post investigation reveals a campaign financestrategy of the past few months under which the DNC collected more than [[$1]]million from labor unions, corporations and fat cats in "soft money" thatcannot be used directly for congressional or presidential campaigns and handedit over to at least a dozen state Democratic parties, which then sent back tothe DNC unrestricted "hard money" funds that can be spent on individual races.The state parties, reports the Post , have been charging a 10 to 15percent commission for their part in these swaps. The paper says campaignreform advocates conclude that the scheme, "while legal, renders meaningless"the distinction between general-use-only soft money and unrestricted hardmoney.            The death of convicted Martin Luther King assassin James Earl Ray getsfront-page coverage at USAT , the NYT , and LAT and isinside at the WP . The coverage notes that the Department of Justice, "review of the case, based on information recently submitted by Kings family,", "which had come to support Rays drive for a new trial, will continue.",             The WP has a front-page report on disturbing new research by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention indicating that the recent decline in U.S. AIDS cases is not due toa notable drop in new infections, but rather to improved medical treatment ofthe disease. The rate of HIV infection among the populace, says the study, hasin fact remained quite stable. Despite considerable public education effortstargeting them, young people and intravenous drug users continue to contractHIV at high rates.            The NYT front runs a Felicity Barringer piece that details animportant aspect of the recent proliferation of federal investigations:prosecutors are pressing reporters more and more for theirnotes and other source materials and to a surprising degree, getting them. And, "unlike past press-prosecutor conflicts, these latest episodes arent drawing", much media coverage. According to the piece (which credits earlierlittle-noticed reports of such matters in the media-related press), in recentmonths, the feds have had their subpoena for the complete tape of DianeSawyer\s "PrimeTime Live" interview with Susan McDougal upheld and got theinterview tapes writer James B. Stewart made with McDougal for a NewYorker piece he wrote. And under a subpoena served on him by the FBI in the, "lobby of Time s Washington bureau, reporter Jeffrey Birnbaum gave the", government transcripts of his on-the-record conversations with a former WhiteHouse aide. It is, Barringer writes, "a new season in First Amendment law."            The Wall Street Journal reports that its latest poll(undertaken with NBC News) indicates 66 percent of the public approve of thejob Bill Clinton is doing. Only 4 percent of those surveyed think he will haveto resign.            The WP \s "Reliable Source" column makes a gimlet observation on Paula, "Jones determination to appear this weekend in the same room as President", "Clinton at the White House Correspondents Dinner. In the deposition Jones made", for her lawsuit, notes the column, she testified, "Every time I look at this, "man on TV--I dont even look. I just turn it off because it brings back that", terrible day..."                                                   Sexual Positioning                           USA, "Hello leads with Kathleen Willeys lawyers defense of her motives in", coming forward. The Washington Post leads with the apparent intention of, "President Clintons lawyer in the Paula Jones case, Robert Bennett, to submit", "material to the trial judge today covering Jones past sex life to rebut her", claim in her previous filings that her alleged encounter with Clinton left herwith an alleged "sexual aversion injury." The Post notes that not toolong ago, Bennett said one of the things he would not do in this trial would be, "go into Jones sexual history. The New York Times", "leads with the reform pledges made by Chinas new prime minister. And the", LosAngeles Times goes with the purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers byRupert Murdoch.                           USAT reports that according to Willey\s lawyer, she is "overwhelmed"by White House attempts to discredit her. Regarding the release of admiringletters she had written to Clinton after their disputed Oval Office meeting, heis quoted saying, "We don\t pretend we can compete with the White House spinmachine." Reports about Willey on the WP and NYT front alsofollow up on the story broken yesterday by the New York Daily News thatprior to her "60 Minutes" appearance, she had been in discussions with atabloid.            The NYT reports that the new Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji gave apress conference in which he laid down ambitious goals for sweeping socialchange in his country, including pledges to redesign the government and cut itsstaff in half, do away with subsidized housing, and make state-owned industriessolvent, all within the next three years. But he also flatly ruled out, reports, "the Times , any reappraisal of the governments crackdown on democracy in", Tiananmen Square. The press conference was strikingly Western-style, says the, "paper, complete with Zhus deflection of a serious question about eventual", national elections with a quip about pictures of him in Time andNewsweek .            About a third of the LAT front is given over to coverage of the Dodger sale. In an unexpectedly one-sided vote,, "major league baseball owners approved the sale of the team by the OMalley", "family to Rupert Murdochs Fox Group, for about [$311 million], the most ever", paid for a sports franchise. The move makes the team part of a world-wide mediaempire valued at nearly [$27 billion]. Among those assets, points out theLAT , are broadcast and cable rights to games played by 22 of the 30major league teams. And this is the aspect of the deal that is reallydifferent. A second LAT front-page piece states that the purchase price,almost double the going rate in baseball, is "so far out of the ballpark thatit\s highly unlikely the team will make money," but, the paper explains,"Murdoch sees sports team as another form of content for his sprawlingtelevision empire....", "            The Dodger deal is also on the front at the WP , but doesnt make the", NYT front, which opts instead for a story about how George Steinbrennerhas discussed the possibility of selling a piece of the Yankees.            The Wall Street Journal reports that a jury in Muncie, Indiana, "ruled that the nations largest cigarette makers shouldnt be held liable in", the lung cancer death of a non-smoking nurse. Jurors said that cigarettes, "werent a defective product and that the manufacturers werent negligent for", failing to tell people that second-hand smoke was dangerous.            Both the NYT and WP fronts carry word of a new study from theFederal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a surprising rise in, "the suicide rate among black teenagers. The studys authors suggest that the", surge reflects the strain black families feel in transitioning to the middleclass. One odd detail: black teenagers are much more likely than whiteteenagers to kill themselves in the presence of somebody else.            The general degree of personality-, sports- and money-euphoria surroundingthe Murdoch Dodger buy is well illustrated by the LAT front-pageeffusions of L.A. mayor Richard Riordan who is quoted saying, "I\ve never metanybody whose focus is better....He pays the same attention to the waiter as hedoes to the most important person in the room." Isn\t that the opposite offocus?                                                   Congress Drifts and Coasts            The near-global stock market plunge, with an especially deep crisis inMoscow, leads at USA Hello , the Los AngelesTimes , and the New YorkTimes . A behind-the-scenes look at the just-unsealed ruling against the, "White Houses use of executive privilege in the Monica Lewinsky investigation", leads at the Washington Post (and is the top national story at theNYT , LAT and USAT ).            On Wednesday, market indexes dropped in Hong Kong, Japan, Frankfurt, Paris,London, and the U.S. (although by the end of trading, the Dow had recovered, "most of the days losses). Nothing compared with Russias troubles though,", "where yesterdays 10 percent dip in the stock market meant a cumulative", shrinkage of 40 percent this month. USAT says the proximate cause was, "Moodys downgrading the rating of five Japanese banks and deploring the entire", banking system of Indonesia. The WP cites that as well as indicationsHong Kong is set to announce its first GDP slip in a decade. All of this fits, "under the NYT s general explanation: investors are increasingly shunning", markets in developing countries.            Sometimes the narrative in economic flash stories is a little brisk. Whatcan the non-economist get from such sentences as USAT \s "In a bid torestore confidence, the Russian central bank tripled key interest rates to astaggering 150%."? Staggering interest rates just don\t sound confidencebuilding. The NYT and LAT leads, which focus on the Russianeconomy, meet this challenge with the sprinkling of additional Econ 101information required: jacked-up rates of return encourage investors to hold on, "to their rubles rather than selling them for dollars. Still, the reader cant", help but be confused by the widely quoted pronouncement by the head of the IMF:"Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining, this is not acrisis."            The dailies report that federal judge Norma Johnson agreed with PresidentClinton that executive privilege for both the president and First Lady, as wellas lawyer-client privilege for certain presidential discussions with aides, arelegitimate notions. But, they add, after Ken Starr made a private presentationto her of secret grand jury evidence, she decided the privileges are trumped bythe particulars of the Lewinsky case. The Post says the legal papers Clinton submitted make itclear that early on, the Lewinsky scandal, despite public assertions by aidesto the contrary, was seriously affecting his ability to focus on his job. Thepapers also show that the specter of impeachment was very real for him--soreal, Clinton claimed, that he needed candid and private advice from aides, "about how to combat it. Snippets from Starrs brief suggest nothing short of", Absolute Power : "If a president were to murder a political opponent, hewould argue that the resulting uproar could impair his legislative program,distract him from his duties, affect his dealings with foreign heads of state,and potentially give rise to impeachment proceedings--the very arguments raisedby the White House here..."            Ready for another high-profile digital anti-trust case that will no doubtalso drag on for years? Well, the Wall Street Journal and NYT fronts report thatFederal Trade Commission investigators are recommending civil antitrust chargesagainst Intel Corp., alleging that the chip maker used its dominant marketposition unfairly against smaller competitors. (The WP carries the storyinside.)            Everybody reports another computer development, which the NYTbusiness section calls "a glimpse of the future the government is seeking" inits case against Microsoft: namely, the Gateway computer company negotiatedpermission from MS to make Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer equallyconvenient choices from Gateway start-up screens.            In a gimlet editorial, the WP says it may be too early to callthis Congress "do-nothing," but not too early to call it "done-nothing." Sure,notes the Post , there was the (budget-busting, drunk-driving-ignoring)highway bill, but what about tobacco legislation, campaign finance reform, astudent loan bill, health care, food stamps for needy immigrants, child caresubsidies, reforming the Endangered Species Act and Superfund, or paying up ourU.N. bill?            But, according to the NYT , in at least one area, Congress has takencharge. In hearings last week, a House committee heard from various Platters,Drifters, Coasters, and Vogues all requesting that federal law be amended toprotect oldies groups from other performers using the theirgroup-names. They can say what they want about our schools, our health care,and our campaign financing, but this country takes a backseat to no one when itcomes to fighting against doowop knockoffs .                                                   The Marines Should Have Landed                           USAHello leads with an unprecedented court decision reinstalling in the, "Miami mayors office the former incumbent defeated at the polls last November.", The Washington Post leads with the finding by militaryaccident investigators that the crew of a Marine jet was at fault in the deathsof twenty civilians in the Alps last month. The New York Timesleads with word that the American Stock Exchange and the National Associationof Securities Dealers are discussing a stock exchange merger. The Los Angeles, "Times goes with California Gov. Pete Wilsons executive abolition of", "affirmative action in the awarding of state contracts. Wilsons announcement", came just days after the courts said such a move would be legal.            The WP reports that accident investigators found that the Marine jet was flying toolow--only 300 to 400 feet when it was supposed to be at 2,000-- and toofast--more than 100 miles per hour over the prescribed limit for theroute--when it struck that Italian cable car wire. (By the way, the Postis wrong to say the plane was going "100 knots per hour" too fast--a "knot" isa (nautical) mile per hour.) As a result, says the paper, they recommend thatthe crew face "some sort of punishment." The NYT , LAT , andUSAT are, in their front-page pieces on the finding, all clearer aboutwhat kind: court-martial and prison. In addition, say the papers, superiors in, "the aviators chain of command are also likely to be subject to further", administrative action. Everybody notes that authorities hope the tough stancewill ease Italian demands to try the aviators in the Italian courts.            None of the papers are very clear on why not only the pilot but also the, "other officers in the planes crew could plausibly be held accountable. None", mentions that the EA6B only has one set of flight controls and that therefore, "the three electronic warfare officers on board cannot control the planes", speed, altitude or course. The Post barely brushes this topic,speculating that the investigators may have concluded the tragedy resulted froma decision by the entire crew. But for all the papers say, the finding makes as, "much sense as holding a stewardess responsible for a commercial pilots flight", violations.            The NYT lead quickly becomes a primer on the history of therelevant stock markets and the differences in mechanics and culture among them.But inexcusably, the piece delays until the ninth paragraph any hint of why thepossible merger could be of interest to the general public: it could mean, "savings for investors. The merger story is also a leader at the Wall Street Journal , but doesnt make anybody elses", front.            A USAT inside piece on Linda Tripp reveals that she never labeled thetapes she made of her phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky, but did keepher TV on during the calls, knowing that the World Series broadcasts and sitcomepisodes audible in the background would enable the particular calls to bedated.            The WSJ reports that last year, the purchase of the average-priced new vehicle took almost, "exactly half a years worth of median family income. That sounds high, so the", real surprise is that, according to the Journal , this is the lowestlevel since 1980.            The WP reports the results of a joint Associated Press-Center forResponsive Politics survey on lobbying, which show that interest groups arespending [[[[$1]]00] million] a month to pressure the federal government on pet issues.The number one noodge is the American Medical Association, which, in the firsthalf of 1997, the most recent available reporting period, spent [$8.6]million.            The NYT has a big illustrated front-page piece on the recentdiscovery that an asteroid, called "1997 XF 11," is likely to pass within, "30,000 miles of Earth (thats eight times closer than the moon) on October 26,", "2028. Whats more, theres a possibility it will hit Earth then. (The asteroid", story also makes the USAT front and is inside the WP .) Theastronomer making the announcement is quoted saying there is "no immediatecause for alarm." (That\s right--the cause for alarm is thirty years from now.)We have, he says, plenty of time "to improve our knowledge of this thing andtake steps, if necessary." Steps, like, says the Times , blowing up anuclear bomb near the asteroid. The Times also mentions that two moviescoming out later this year deal with the scenario of threatened interstellarcollisions. The producers of those movies must just be sooo upset aboutthis news., "            TP thinks the big question isnt whether 1997 XF 11 will hit us in", "2028--its how will it affect Ken Starrs investigation.",                                                    Papal Bull                           USAHello and the Washington Post lead with the White House response toKathleen Willey. The New York, "Times leads with the Vaticans official repentance regarding the mass", killings of Jews during World War II. And the Los AngelesTimes goes with the news that the first three University of Californiacampuses to generate admissions statistics since the system abandonedaffirmative action have seen their black and Latino acceptance ratesplummet., "            Yesterdays White House response to Willey was primarily two-fold: a strong", denial from President Clinton, and the release of a raft of friendly lettersWilley sent to the White House after the date she alleges she was groped byClinton. In one letter, widely quoted, she calls herself Clinton\s "number onefan." In another, Willey asks to be appointed to an ambassadorship. TheNYT says some of the letters were "effusive." And a piece insideUSAT says they "do not suggest a woman who felt betrayed." (There was, "also the effort of Clintons personal lawyer, Robert Bennett, noted by the", NYT and USAT , to portray Willey as mercenary for trying to land abook deal.), "            None of the days coverage of the Willey letters pays the slightest heed to", the well-known phenomenon of even physically abused women having troubleexpressing their animosity towards their abusers or physically separating from, "them. Its as if nobody in the entire press corps remembers that Nicole Brown", Simpson moved back in with O.J. after those pictures were taken of her pummeledface.            Despite the six-cylinder spin cycle, USAT says that "there was noignoring the dark mood that settled over the White House" in Willey\s wake. Thepaper noted a rare moment of anger by Mike McCurry, who lashed out at areporter who asked him whether Clinton had ever received psychologicaltreatment or counseling for risky and reckless behavior.            The WP lead makes that point that when originallyconfronted with the Willey charges, Clinton released a statement saying that hehad "no specific recollection" of meeting with her, but that his current denialis based on "a very clear memory" of the meeting.                           USAT notes that Ann Lewis, who spearheaded the anti-Willeycounteroffensive yesterday with an appearance on the "Hello" show, was aleading supporter of Anita Hill. But the Post lead puts a finer point onthe matter, noting, "Democratic activists--Lewis among them--had accusedRepublicans of attacking the victim when they noted in the Clarence Thomasconfirmation hearings in 1991 that Anita Hill had continued to stay in closetouch with Thomas even after he allegedly harassed her with lewd sexualremarks."            Such apparently effortless shifting by some women is called to taskpointedly in the Wall Street Journal \s main "Politics and Policy" piece viaa quotation from a Democratic consultant, who says, "What gets to the heart ofit is that feminism is no longer a principle, it\s a political tool."            The NYT lead concerning the Vatican points out that while thedocument issued Monday is described by the Church as "an act of repentance" forthe failure of Roman Catholics to deter the mass killings in Europe during the, "Holocaust, it skirts the issue of the Vaticans institutional shortcomings", during the era, primarily its official silence about the Nazis. The document,says the paper, took 11 years to prepare, and was greeted coolly by Jewishleaders. Everybody carries the repentance story on the front page., "            Everybodys front page also carries word that the McKinney trial jury didnt", send the former sergeant major of the Army to jail, but did bust him down onerank, a move that will cost him [[$1]]0,000 a year in pension money. Also, McKinneysued his initial accuser for libel, asking [[$1]].5 million. Meanwhile, theLAT and NYT fronts report that Defense Secretary William Cohen, "rejected an advisory commissions recommendation that male and female recruits", be housed separately during training.            The NYT runs the following correction: "Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 26, "about Manhattanites reliance on mini-storage referred incorrectly to doves and", a rabbit used in the act of Arnie Kolodner, a magician. While he keeps costumesin mini-storage, the rabbit and doves live in his home. A correction in thisspace on Saturday omitted mention of the rabbit."                                                   Bank Shot            The New York Timesnational edition leads with the U.S.-driven delay of World Bank loans to Indiain response to its recent A-bomb tests. The Washington Post leads with the reduction of the Americanmilitary presence in the Persian Gulf. The Los Angeles, "Times goes with the Supreme Courts unanimous ruling that police are", generally shielded from liability for deaths or injuries caused by theirhigh-speed pursuits. (The WP and NYT carry this story inside.)USAHello leads with the disparate treatments various tobacco productsreceive under the bill now pending in the Senate. For instance, it restrictsthe advertising and marketing of cigarettes, but not that of cigars or pipetobacco. As a result, some health advocates are concerned, says the paper, that, "the bill wont discourage overall tobacco use, but would only redirect it.", , "            The NYT points out that the World Banks action to stop loans for an electrical power grid not", only hits India--a country frequently affected by power failures andshortages--hard, but also serves as a signal to Pakistan about what sorts ofsanctions it can expect if it responds to India with a nuclear test of its own.(The paper reports that the CIA told the White House on Tuesday that Pakistancould detonate an underground nuke at any time.) The threat of more sanctions, "has already sent Indias currency plunging to an all-time low against the", dollar. Japan, says the Times , also sought the loan action.            Defense Secretary William Cohen announced that U.S. military forces in theGulf region had begun drawing down to pre-Iraqi-crisis levels because of, "Baghdads assurances of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and to help", improve military readiness and morale. Another factor: domestic politicalpressures inside such host countries as Bahrain.            The LAT reports that the Court decision even protects police who actrecklessly in conducting pursuits. Because, say the Justices, the decision to, "pursue is often necessarily a split-second one, and violates no ones", constitutional rights. The story observes that about the same number ofpeople--300--are killed every year in police chases as in police shootings,which of course makes "Hello\s Papers" wonder why the law should treat recklesspolice driving differently than reckless police shooting. After all, thedecision to shoot is usually just as split-second., "            The WP s front reports that as part of Ken Starrs effort to", "methodically reconstruct the details of Monica Lewinskys life that she", communicated to her erstwhile friend Linda Tripp, Lewinsky has been asked toprovide fingerprints and a handwriting sample to investigators, "today. Is there an end in sight for Starrs investigation? Well, the", Post says he is looking to expand his office space.            The Wall Street Journal reports that in a phone campaignundertaken against California Prop. 226, the union dues "paycheck protection"measure, a Florida telemarketing firm claimed that the initiative would imperilcops by leading to the disclosure of their home addresses, with the result thatthey would become targets for gang members. The Journal observes that, "226 only requires a name, signature, and employers identification for the", approval of union dues for political purposes, not an address.            The USAT front brings word that based on phone surveillance, policein five European countries detained more than 80 Islamic militants suspected ofplanning to disrupt the World Cup soccer matches, scheduled to start next monthin ten French cities. The story is carried inside elsewhere.            The NYT front and the WP inside run stories reporting that a governmentpanel has hesitantly approved a vaccine against Lyme disease. The main sourcesof reluctance are that nobody knows how many shots are needed nor if thevaccine is safe for people with arthritis or undiagnosed Lyme disease. Thestories are lacking in context. The WP says that the tick-spreadflu-mimicking disease is "a serious threat" in parts of the country, and theNYT national edition mentions in the sixth paragraph that the latestgovernment statistics show 16,000 cases annually. (The version of the storyappearing in the later, metro edition of the paper omits this.) And theTimes says severe cases can result in arthritis, and nervous system and, "heart damage. But the paper doesnt say how many cases turn out like this. And", neither story states the number of Lyme deaths, if any. We are merely told bythe Times that the disease is "a cause of great concern each summer forparents and those who spend a lot of time outdoors." In short, nothing in thestories alleviates a creeping suspicion that this disease, while of greatconcern to newspaper editors with summer places in Connecticut and children atCamp Heapumwampum, is hardly on a par with say, rat bites, lead-paintpoisoning, and malnutrition suffered by inner-city kids.                                                   McCain Mutiny                           USAHello , the Washington Post , and the New York Timeslead with the failure in the Senate of the Feingold-McCain campaign reformbill, which would have barred the national political parties from traffickingin "soft money." The Los Angeles Times goes with the federal indictment of eightCalifornia corrections officials suspected of conspiracy and cover-up inconnection with various improprieties concerning inmates, including asuspicious death.            The Feingold-McCain defeat came Thursday at the hands of a Republican-ledfilibuster. This was, in the words of USAT , "nearly a replay" of the, "bills fate last fall. The repetitive outcome, showed, says the paper, that a", year of publicity about the excesses of political fund-raising had "failed tochange a single senator\s mind.", "            The bills opponents, led by Sen. Trent Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, argue", that new fund-raising limitations amount to an infringement on free speech. ButMcConnell gives away the game in telling the NYT that three groups thatprovide what he calls "valuable grass-roots support" (=soft money) had stronglyopposed the reform bill. The three: the National Rifle Association, theChristian Coalition, and the National Right to Life Committee. The Timesgoes on to point out that while for the past year, Senate Republicans had put, "the spotlight on President Clintons more unseemly fund-raising efforts, they", have fiercely resisted any legislative fix that would cancel their fund-raisingadvantage, which USAT spells out: [$40.2 million ]in soft money, compared, "to the Democrats [$33.3 million]. The WP and NYT both report that", Democrats intend to run on the issue in the fall congressional elections., "Everybody quotes Sen. John McCains reason for believing that eventually,", public pressure for change will increase: "There will be more scandals, moreindictments and more people going to jail.", "            Theres another LAT front-page story about jail abuses: the L.A. City", "Sheriffs department is investigating the possibility that beatings of accused", "child molesters were allegedly encouraged by deputies working in the mens", central jail and resulted in at least one homicide.            Meanwhile, the NYT reports that the federal government on Thursdayformally took over the prosecution of police officers implicated in the brutalattack last summer on Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. Conviction on the federalcivil rights charges could mean sentences of up to life in prison. The fiveofficers charged pleaded not guilty and remain free on bond., "            The same picture of a jubilant Oprah Winfrey celebrating a federal jurys", finding of no liability in her mad cow trial runs on the fronts of each of thefour dailies that use photos. The caption and headline writers join the fun:"Jurors: no beef with Oprah" ( USAT ), "Savoring Victory" ( LAT ) and"Next On Oprah: Freedom Of Speech" ( WP ).            The lead NYT editorial observes that Washington is now"enthralled by the idea that James Bond methods can remove Saddam Hussein frompower," and points out that a tonic for that idea is found in the recentlyreleased internal CIA report about the Bay of Pigs failure. Both cases, saysthe Times , represent overly optimistic expectations that entrencheddictators can be toppled by small acts of insurrection.            The Wall Street Journal reports that HarperCollins, owned byRupert Murdoch, was to have published the memoirs of Chris Patten, last Britishgovernor of Hong Kong, but the two have parted company. The paper quotes peoplefamiliar with the situation as saying that Murdoch had balked at printingpassages critical of the Chinese government. The WSJ points out thatMurdoch has a track record of using his media empire to advance his interestsin China. For instance, in 1994, his News Corp. dropped the BBC from the, "collection of channels it beams into China because the Chinese didnt like the", BBC program on Mao.            The WP \s "Reliable Source" column says that yesterday, reporterscovering the Food and Drug Administration received an official e-mail from the, "FDA press office that was.a long list of Clinton sex jokes. (Were assuming", about, not by.) The agency is "looking into it."            According to the USAT "Snapshot," fully 62 percent of members of theU.S. college class of 2001--which the paper notes, includes ChelseaClinton--would not ever consider doing what either of their parents do for aliving.                                                   Lott to Learn                           USAHello leads with plunging gasoline prices. The Washington Post leads with the latest line of inquiryundertaken by Kenneth Starr. The New York Times, "goes with Sen. Trent Lotts new take on Starrs inquiry--its slowness is the", "Presidents fault. And the Los Angeles Times goes with the surprise objection", raised by the federal government to the proposed Lockheed/Northrop merger.                           USAT cites warmer-than-usual winters in the U.S. and Europe and a, "drop in Asian demand because of that regions economic crisis as explanatory", "factors for the price drop. In its front pager, the WP adds OPECs", increased production. The result, is, says USAT , that gas is now selling, "at the equivalent of 27 cents a gallon in 1973 dollars. The WP says its", less than 25 cents. Both papers say prices will rise when the summer travelseason gets underway.            The WP lead reports that Starr is investigating whether KathleenWilley, a former White House aide alleged by Linda Tripp to have once receivedan unsolicited sexual advance from President Clinton in the Oval Office, wasever asked by people with Clinton ties to alter her testimony about such anincident. The Post notes that one such person Starr may investigate is aDemocratic fund-raiser who may have called and met with Willey. In the piece,the Post mentions that last summer Tripp was contacted about Willey by"a Newsweek reporter." Why can\t the WP bear to identify thatreporter as Michael Isikoff, the man who broke the Monica L. story? Is thesilence a form of shunning Isikoff, a former long-time Post reporter wholeft the paper under strained circumstances?            Over the weekend, Trent Lott had said it was time for Starr to "show hiscards." But on Monday, Lott was, in the NYT \s words, "recalibrating" his, "views by now blaming Starrs meager results on the White House. He called for the president to come forward and tell the whole truth", about the Lewinsky matter. Lott added that he believes the scandal isbeginning to have an impact on the presidency.            The WP today provides a sneak peak at a letter of apology former conservative hit man David Brock has written toPresident Clinton for the upcoming Esquire . The upshot: Brock now admitshe dug up the dirt for his American Spectator piece on Troopergate for, "ideological reasons and hes sorry. Incidentally, Brock writes that he didnt", think "Paula" (he didn\t use her last name) could ever have been identified. Hesays now it was "an oversight" to have left that name in.            After an eight-month review, federal regulators on Monday revealed seriousobjections to the nearly [[[$1]]2 billion] Lockheed/Northrop merger, and may filesuit to block it. The LAT says the news surprised the company and shocked, "investors, who punished Northrops stock. According to the paper, the", "government wants Lockheed to divest all of Northrops defense electronics", programs, which may be a deal-breaker, since acquiring them was one of the, "mergers prime motivations.",             The Wall Street Journal and NYT accounts stress that thegovernment is concerned that consolidation among military suppliers may havegone too far to maintain competition. (Although, the Journal notes that, "the Navy is for the merger, because it would resuscitate Grummans carrier", aviation lines.) For instance, the NYT points out that the mergedcompany would be virtually the only supplier to the Pentagon of certain radarand electronic warfare systems, and would leave the country with only two, "manufacturers of warplanes. The papers all point out that the governments", reaction is of a piece with its recent tougher antitrust policy with respect toMicrosoft. The LAT quotes one stock analyst: "I think the JusticeDepartment is taking steroids."            The WP reports that Rep. John Boehner sued Rep. Jim McDermott yesterdaycharging that McDermott violated his privacy illegally leaking the tape of atelephone conversation involving Newt Gingrich, Boehner and other Republicanleaders discussing the ethics investigation into Gingrich. It is believed thismarks the first time one sitting member of Congress has sued another in hispersonal capacity.            According to the USAT "Snapshot," California, the top state for PCuse, expects to have half of its home phone traffic be PC rather than voice by2001.            The Post and LAT report that Rep. Jay Kim, who pleaded guilty toknowingly accepting [$230,000 ]in illegal foreign and corporate campaigncontributions, was sentenced yesterday to a year of probation, a [[[$5,000 ]]]fineand two months of home confinement, to be implemented by an electronicmonitoring device. Since, as the papers point out, the federal program allowsmonitorees to go to and from work, look for Kim to be inundated with arduousmeetings from early morning till late at night. Many of them in finerestaurants. Many of them with...contributors.                                                   The Zero Effect                           USA, "Hello leads with yesterdays U.S. and worldwide stock rally. The", Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with the balanced budget proposed yesterday by PresidentClinton--the first such in thirty years. The New York Times, "goes with Madeleine Albrights attempt to line up Saudi support for any U.S.", military operation against Iraq., "            According to USAT , a 14 percent jump in Hong Kongs stock market on", "Monday fueled the Dows 201 point jump. The paper also cites as a factor the", spreading belief that President Clinton will survive his sex scandal. The rallyalso drove the S&P 500 above 1000 for the first time ever.            The WP lead emphasizes that the Clinton balanced budget proposal barssubstantial new spending until Social Security is fixed. The paper notes thatin contrast to most past years, this proposed budget is not arriving onCapitol Hill dead on arrival. The coverage also features various negativereactions from the likes of Trent Lott, John Kasich, and Newt Gingrich, who isquoted, "This is a budget only a liberal could love." The biggest criticism is, "the budgets use of a proposed tobacco settlement to partially offset new", domestic social spending provisions. But, says the Post , according topolls, these priorities generally conform to what the voters want.            The NYT budget off-lead covers much the same ground but is a bit moresensitive to the political angle, saying the budget presents the president with"another opportunity to portray himself as absorbed in governing, and todeflect accusations that he had an affair.." The LAT also highlightspolitical considerations, saying that the budget was "designed to give, "Democrats an upper hand in Novembers congressional elections and provide Vice", President Al Gore with an edge as the 2000 presidential electionapproaches."            The main Wall Street Journal "Politics and Policy" piece says thatdespite opening Republican potshots, there is likely to be agreement about theprovisions dealing with child care, transportation, and tobacco taxes. TheJournal sees the big conflicts coming over the expansion of Medicare tothose younger than 65, a minimum wage increase, and national teachertesting.            The NYT lead reports that Madeleine Albright came away from her talkswith Saudi leaders with a statement of support for military action if diplomacyfails. However, the paper says, she wants more: access to Saudi air bases likethe U.S. had in Desert Storm. The Times says the Saudis might agree tolet their bases be used for support aircraft, but not bombers. While seekingsupport, Albright has, says the Times , made it clear the U.S. isprepared to go it alone. The WP discloses that Albright did win aircraftstaging permission from Kuwait and is likely also to get green-lighted byBahrain, which she visits next.            The Times also passes along word that Russian negotiators are tryingto cobble a deal that would allow an ad hoc weapons inspection of eightheretofore-off-limits presidential palace sites. But the U.S. is notenthusiastic. The LAT also puts the Albright mission on the front., "            The NYT front reports that theres been a more than forty percent drop in AIDS cases, both in New York City and", nationally.

Ms. L.s Pentagon bosses say her White House trips", "werent for them. A White House spokesman wouldnt confirm the number of visits", for the Times , although one senior official there said the number"sounds about right."            "TP" had to read yesterday\s WP twice before noticing that keymembers of the Post editorial staff are apparently suffering thecerebral ill effects of too much exposure to brightly colored polyester.Witness this lead on Monday\s front: "The issue of whether disabled golferCasey Martin should be allowed to use a golf cart in tournament play hascaptured the nation\s imagination for weeks."

Tripped Up            The New York Timesleads with a bit of a bombshell about the grand jury testimony of President, "Clintons personal secretary. The Washington Post leads with the news that Linda Tripp gave", "an affidavit about Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Wiley to Paula Jones lawyers.", The top national story at the Los Angeles Times is the emerging pressure on theClinton administration to not just strike against Saddam Hussein, but removehim. USAHello goes with the severe storms that are forecasted to punish bothcoasts starting today., "            According to the NYT lead, Ken Starrs quest to find out who the President", knew and when did he know her may have gotten a big boost from the grand juryappearance of Betty Currie, who testified that Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinskywere sometimes alone together in the White House. Additionally, says the paper,the day after giving his Jones case deposition, Clinton told Currie that he hadnever been alone with Monica Lewinsky and that he had resisted her sexualadvances.            Also, the Times reports, Currie turned over to investigators severalgifts that Clinton had given to Lewinsky--a dress, a brooch, and a hatpin., "According to Lewinskys account to Starr, after Jones lawyers issued a", subpoena demanding Lewinsky surrender any gifts the President gave her, she, "discussed this with Clinton and he told her if she didnt have the gifts, she", "wouldnt have to turn them over. And soon after that conversation, says the", Times , Currie collected the items from Lewinsky. The paper also quotes a, "person who has read Clintons deposition as saying that when asked by Jones", lawyers if he had given Lewinsky any gifts, the president replied that perhaps,but only ordinary White House souvenirs., "            The Post lead nails down the scandals earliest known", details. In her January 21, 1998 affidavit for Jones (still under seal butsomehow obtained by the WP ), Tripp says Lewinsky told her of an affairwith Clinton commencing on November 15, 1995, and that Lewinsky had played at, "least three tapes for Tripp containing Clintons voice and showed her gifts", from Clinton. Tripp also says that Lewinsky had told her she planned to lie, "under oath if questioned about the relationship by Jones attorneys.", , "            Inside, the Post runs Tripps sworn statement in its entirety. In it, Tripp", describes herself as having once served in the Clinton White House as an"apolitical careerist."            The Wall Street Journal reports that during his Middle Eastshuttle, Secretary of Defense Cohen may ask some smaller Gulf states to take upto 60 U.S. fighter-bombers now based in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon, says theJournal , feels it can live with the Saudi policy of not allowing U.S.bombers to base there, but still allowing other U.S. combat support aircraft todo so.            The WP front and the NYT inside run stories about the clashbetween U.S. and Italian officials over what happened when that Americanmilitary jet sliced a ski-lift suspension wire killing 20 people. An Americangeneral says the plane was following a standard training route, and thus farthe crew have refused to speak with Italian investigators. The Italians arecharging that the aircraft was too low and was hot-dogging. They are evenalleging that the plane was equipped with a flight data recorder but that theAmericans are withholding it. "Killer pilots" is a phrase that has appeared inthe Italian press.                           USAT reports that the makers of the best-selling drug in the U.S,Astra, has agreed to pay a record nearly [[$1]]0 million to female employees whoclaimed that they were pressured for sex by company officials and urged to wearbikinis at a beach function.            A NYT top front piece discusses how newly released documents from thetobacco industry giants make it clearer than ever just how hard the companiestried to market cigarettes--especially mentholated ones--to blacks. A 1973Brown and Williamson document quoted speaks of the possibility that "Kool willcover the top 25 markets in terms of absolute Negroes." The revelations haveled to calls from minority lawmakers and health authorities that some proceedsfrom any global tobacco settlement be earmarked for minorities.            What with all the headlines about Democratic Party fundraising, you mightthink the Dems take in more dough than the Republicans. You might be wrong--theWP runs a Reuters piece inside stating that in 1997, the GOP raised [$37]million more--[[$1]]14 million to [$77 million]., "            Yesterdays WP ran a story on the current political turmoil in", Zimbabwe under the headline "Winter of Discontent."

USA Hello leads with the FDAs warning about creatine, a", muscle-building supplement widely used by athletes.            The dailies explain that House GOP leaders agreed to allow campaign financelegislation to come to floor votes next month because reform advocates wereclose to getting enough signatures on a special petition to force a voteanyway. President Clinton is quoted saying the development was "great news,"but House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is quoted saying, "This was a retreatnot a conversion. The Republican leadership still opposes reform that reducesthe role of money in politics." And indeed the coverage points out that theSenate has already defeated a ban on "soft money" once this session., "            Both the NYT and USAT fronts cover yesterdays oral arguments", in the fourth and final sexual harassment case the Supreme Court is, "hearing this term. The issue in this one is whether a supervisors single", "threat saying a female subordinates sexual compliance will ease her working", conditions constitutes harassment when her non-compliance meets with no adverseconsequences. The issue is an ingredient in the Paula Jones case and hence the, "Courts decision here might affect her appeal. Both papers note that many of", "the justices seemed genuinely perplexed during yesterdays arguments.", , "            Meanwhile, the WP front observes firm differences about gender on display in the Courts 6-3", decision to uphold the law that automatically grants U.S. citizenship to anout-of-wedlock child if the mother is an American, but not if only the fatheris. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,presumed that there is a closer connection between a mother and her child thanbetween a father and his. But Justice Ruth Ginsburg dissented, taking a pure, "approach to sexual equality. The Post s Joan Biskupic, notes that", generational differences seem to be at play in this decision, with the olderjustices siding with the maternalistic bias., "            No wonder the Administrations announcement the other day that needle", "exchange programs do work but wont be getting federal funds seemed so lame:", according to a front-page story at the WP , until a half-hour beforethe press conference, HHS Secretary Donna Shalala was all set to announcefederal funding. That was when White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles toldher that President Clinton had decided the exchange position was toopolitically risky.            The WP runs an AP report stating that the first national survey ofphysician-assisted suicide found that 6 percent of the front-line doctors, "responding have hastened patients deaths with lethal injections or", prescriptions. The Post story goes on to say that one-third of thesurveyed doctors would write prescriptions for deadly dosages. USAT saysthat 11 percent of doctors would do so. The NYT , in the headline overits survey story, says the finding is that physician-assisted suicide is"rare." Meanwhile, the LAT reports on its front that Linda McCartney didnot die in Santa Barbara as the family first reported. The family admits nowthat this was a diversion which, says the paper, has in turn spurred some talkthat perhaps her death was an assisted suicide.            The WP front reports that NATO planning last summer to captureBosnian Serb leader and wanted war criminal Radovan Karadzic was compromisedwhen a French military officer met secretly with Karadzic. The NYT runsthe story inside, crediting the Post .            According to the WSJ, the IRS estimates that in 1996 taxpayers who itemizedgave [$84.3 billion ]to charity, up 12.4% from 1995. Concomitantly, manycharities are having banner years. For instance, the Journal notesBaylor Healthcare System Foundation has raised [$23 million ]through March,surpassing the [[$1]]7 million it raised in all of last year.            The NYT front reports on a new web page for kids set up by the CIA(www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids). The site is laced with trivia quizzes on worldgeography and history. And it explains the agency\s purpose: "Intelligence is, "information needed by our nations leaders, also known as policy makers, to", keep our country safe.

The Anti-Abortion Racket                           USA, "Hello and the Washington Post lead with a Chicago jurys finding in a", lawsuit brought by NOW that anti-abortion groups violated federal racketeeringlaws by conspiring to close abortion clinics through violence, and hence couldbe subject to damage claims. The national edition of the New York Times, "leads with a U.S.-British operation thats currently relocating nuclear", material from the nation of Georgia to England to keep it out of the hands ofIran, Chechen gangs or aspiring nuclear powers. The top national story at theLos, "Angeles Times is the Supreme Courts decision to hear a case involving", a Chicago ordinance targeting gang members for gathering on city streets. (Thestory also makes the front at USAT and is inside at the WP .)            The three anti-abortion organizers found in effect to be racketeers areactive in Operation Rescue and/or the Pro-Life Action League. They were finedmore than a quarter million dollars. Throughout the trial, says the WP ,attorneys for the defendants claimed that any curbs on the anti-abortiondemonstrators would violate their free speech rights. But the paper carriesthis rejoinder from an ACLU staffer: "The Constitution has never been found to, "protect extortion: someone saying theyll break your windows every day or", someone stationing a thug outside your business." The story also makes the, "NYT front, but not the LAT s.",             The Times reports that the Georgian nuclear materials (experts, "disagree about whether its enough to make a nuclear bomb, says the paper) were", originally supposed to be moved to Russia, but after the Russians failed tofollow through, the U.S., concerned about the instability of the region,typified by the recent assassination attempt on the Georgian leader, EduardShevardnadse, made other plans while keeping Moscow informed.            The LAT front brings word that NOW, after staying on the sidelineswhile Paula Jones still had a case headed for trial, is currently consideringproviding support for her appeal of its recent dismissal. Hmmm...maybe theyshould be called LATER....            The front pages at USAT , the WP , and the NYT reportthat the Clinton administration announced Monday that it will not do anabout-face on a nine-year-old policy against funding needle-exchange programsfor drug users, even while acknowledging that such programs reduce the spreadof AIDS without encouraging drug abuse. The NYT has the most detail onthe inside politics of the decision, reporting not only that theadministration drug czar, Gen. McCaffrey, is vehemently opposed to lifting the, "ban ( USAT has this too), but also that the presidents policy advisors", were afraid Republicans might push through legislation taking federal moneyaway from organizations providing free needles. Health and Human Servicessecretary Donna Shalala said that the decision was made because research showsthat the best programs are designed locally. So why not design them locally andfund them federally?            The Wall Street Journal reports that child labor is flourishing, "in the U.S., because when the economy is strong, employers cant find enough", adult cheap labor. It is estimated, says the paper, that there are more than300,000 underage children working illegally in the U.S., more than half oncommercial farms., "            The Journal s front-page features a rather moving story about a", black high-school senior from Berkeley who has her heartset on the University of California, but whose good-but-not-great credentialsmean a turn-down in the new-post-affirmative action regime there. The storyshows a not-altogether well-thought out applications process: for example, shedecided not to pursue Bryn Mawr merely because she learned some other blackstudents at her school were also urged to apply by a black student at thecollege, and was interested in another much lesser school because shemistakenly thought it was free. And in the course of the story she learns thather mother voted for Prop. 209., "            Theres been a lot of reason lately to question the overall economic", wonderfulness of high national savings rates, but the "USA Snaphot" inUSAT is pretty disturbing nevertheless: it says that 43 percent ofworking-aged American men, and 42 percent of working-aged American women have, "three months worth of income or less in savings.", , "            Mondays NYT contained William Safires twenty-fifth anniversary", column, which confirms just how little WS learned from Watergate. Safire saysthat on his way out of the Nixon White House he thought about going in to saygoodbye to the boss, but opted not to. And a good thing, he writes, because "atthat moment a faithless aide was in there talking about a cancer on thePresidency" and "had I gone in, I would have been taped and perhaps latercharged with being part of a cover-up." In other words, Safire still sees John, "Dean as a traitor, so much so that he cant bring himself to type his name in", this story, and he still seems to think that a lot of innocent people gotcaught up in Watergate.                                                   Too Public Relations            Killer tornadoes hitting the Southeast lead at USA Hello andthe New York Times .The incredible expanding budget surplus leads at the Washington Post , and the Los Angeles, "Times goes with the Japanese prime ministers decision to try", "countering his countrys sliding economy by offering tax cuts.",             The Times has Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Bragg, whose forte isSouthern atmosphere, on the tornado case. He paints quite a picture of the death (at least 38 victims) anddestruction. "A ragged line of storms ripped through one little town afteranother in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, destroying homes, churches andschools, burying hundreds in rubble, even sucking people out of their damagedhouses and leaving one man dead in the branches of a tree." Bragg notes thatthe National Weather Service gave the twister the most powerful rating on itsstorm scale, but all its victims knew was that it "was off the scale of theirexperience."            The tornadoes are also top front at the WP . And the WP ,NYT , and LAT all feature stunning top-front pictures of thedevastation. Oddly though, the LAT puts the story itself deepinside.            The WP lead drives home the point that the folks who for all thoseyears did such a below-average job of estimating budget deficits also stink atestimating budget surpluses. The paper reports that the Federal Reserve nowsays the surplus will be at least [$50 billion] for this fiscal year, up fromrecent official estimates of [[$1]]0 billion.            The LAT reports that Japanese P.M. Hashimoto has bowed to a "torrentof pressure from the United States, international investors, and elite Japanesebusiness leaders" and swapped his trademark fiscal austerity policies for aneconomic stimulus package featuring lush tax cuts designed to persuade Japaneseconsumers to do some spending. The tax cuts are also on the front pages at the, "NYT and WP . As the LAT explains, Japans increasingly high", savings rate has only exacerbated the Asian economic crisis, by drying up a bigexport market for the floundering neighboring economies. And the NYTadds that the U.S. has been advocating some sort of domestic stimulus becauseof the risk that Japan might try to save itself instead by not only reducingimports but also by dramatically increasing its exports.            "Hello\s Papers" is somewhat surprised that none of the Hashimoto reportingmentions the situation in the U.S. in 1993 when the incoming Clintonadministration was likewise attempting to address a sluggish economy. Withinthe new government, there were strong deficit-cutting and economic stimulusfactions. But the deficit cutters got the upper hand and it is now widelybelieved that their course of action has been the key to the current good times, "here. Isnt this relevant to the Japan coverage?",             A big LAT front-page piece reveals that Microsoft has been secretlyplanning a massive media campaign that, the paper says, was designedto influence state investigators contemplating further anti-trust action by"creating the appearance of a groundswell of public support" for the company.The plan included "the planting of articles, letters to the editor and opinionpieces" to be commissioned by Microsoft but presented as spontaneous localofferings about "how wonderful it is to do business with Microsoft." When thepaper first asked Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw about this yesterday, Shaw said, "he was unaware of such a plan. But Shaws name is on some of the confidential", "company documents in the LAT s possession and he later acknowledged the", PR plan but said it was "merely a proposal." The ad campaign per se does nottrouble "Hello\s Papers," but the idea of planting stories disguised asindependent efforts does. "TP" hopes that the independent stance of theprevious sentence is not thought by readers to in fact be part of a coordinatedcompany effort to simulate independence (GREG--Was this what you wantedhere?).            The Wall Street Journal "Legal Beat" column reports that for, "the first time ever the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the U.N.s", main legal arm, has intervened in a U.S. criminal case and ordered the U.S. tostay the execution of a Paraguayan citizen convicted of murder in Virginia. Theissue here, one that occurs not infrequently in the case of foreign nationalcriminal suspects, is that the cops forgot to tell the man about his right totalk to the Paraguayan consulate.            The NYT op-ed page features a satirical piece by two Harvard Lampooneditors on the trend of luxury compensation packages being used to lure tenuredfaculty stars from one elite university to another. But the piece is anchoredin fact: Columbia recently successfully enticed a Harvard econ prof with apackage that included a [$300,000] salary, a [$55,000]-a-year job for his wife andhelp getting their son admission to a tony prep school.                                                   Lethal Weapon II            Additional Indian atomic tests on Wednesday and U.S. sanctions against Indialead all around. President Clinton justified the economiccountermeasures--stopping all American foreign aid, government credit and mostU.S. bank loans and opposing all international bank loans--by citing the"dangerous new instability" the blasts have created in the region. To head it, "off, Clinton telephoned Pakistans prime minister to urge him not to test nukes", too. The papers report that Clinton received no assurances. The New YorkTimes claims that Pakistan is preparing for an underground test as soon asthis Sunday.            The Washington Post stresses that the second round of Indianexplosions was just as much a surprise to the world as the first. TheNYT emphasizes the defiance of the second round. The, "            Posts reporting suggests that Indian motivations are not crystal clear,", with one senior aide to Prime Minister Vajpayee quoted as saying that the testswere scheduled a month ago and were not intended as a rebuff to internationalcriticism, while another stated, "The news of the day is: India defies worldopinion." Officially, report the Times , the Post and the Wall Street Journal consider abiding by some of the provisions of, "the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and repeated its rejection of Clintons", demand that it sign the treaty.            An inside story at the WP describes the U.S. intelligence failure inthe India matter, and editorials at the Los Angeles Timesand NYT decry it. The NYT editorial argues that besides ourspies, the policy folks at State and the White House fell down on the job too,given that the new Hindu nationalist government of India talked openly of itsinterest in nuclear weapons. There is a real problem here, but the newspapers, "arent exempt. Yes, the intelligence agencies and the national security staffs", are too readily distracted by the current crisis, whatever it is, but the, "dailies are also too crisis-oriented in their coverage. Hellos NYT has", "at least nine articles on India. Last Saturdays Times , published on the", eve of trouble, carried exactly zero.            Characteristically, the WSJ and the NYT include coverage of an, "easily overlooked aspect of the worlds tensest nuclear crisis since the end of", the Cold War--its impact on the Bombay, New Delhi, and Madras stockmarkets.            A piece deep inside the WP brings news that a Russian missile, "specialist has warned that the nuclear ICBMs aboard Russias older submarines", are wearing out so badly that their continued deployment threatens "hundreds ofChernobyls." These comments come, says the Post on the heels of anapparent Russian nuke sub emergency in the Barents Sea just over a week ago.Despite official reassurances, when the sub was brought back to its base therewas widespread panic in the neighboring cities.            The WSJ says although only 17% percent of CEOs say they regularlywatch television, 72% plan to watch tonight\s "Seinfeld." The WP reports, "that yesterdays Boston Herald ran the basic story line for the episode:", Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer witness a carjacking and are put on trial for, "failing to report it. But the paper doesnt claim to know how things turn out.", Is it just "Hello\s Papers" that wonders how it can be that witness testimonybefore just about any federal grand jury is on the front page in twenty-fourhours and yet a sitcom plot remains a state secret?                                                   Starr Tracking            Life after Paula for Ken Starr leads all around. USA Hello ,the Washington Post , and the Los Angeles, "Times all emphasize Starrs determination to press on. The New York Times", stresses instead Democratic pressure on Starr to pack it in, noting that theWhite House and Congress were being guided in this by overnight pollingindicating nearly two-thirds of those asked thought the Jones dismissal wasgood for the country.            Starr responded to the Jones result by holding his first extensive meetingwith the press since January (which the NYT characterizes as "defiant,sometimes rambling"), in the driveway of his home. Both USAT and theWP report his case for pressing on sans Paula: "If you lie under oath,if you intimidate a witness, if you seek otherwise to obstruct the process ofjustice, it doesn\t matter who wins and loses in the civil case."            Later on Thursday, Starr had Clinton chief of staff Erskine Bowles broughtbefore the grand jury for questioning. The NYT reports that White Houseaides were "furious" about this because they feel that Bowles has made aparticular effort to wall himself off from the Lewinsky scandal.            President Clinton was asked about the Jones decision yesterday and he iswidely quoted as saying it "speaks for itself." Hillary was described as moreebullient, and was quoted by everyone as saying, "Both Bill and I have feltthroughout this whole thing that it would turn out fine." The NYT has, "Jones confidante Susan Carpenter-McMillan saying that the ruling means its", "open season on women here in this country." The WP says Jesse Jacksonsaw something special about President Clinton getting the news while in Africa:"It\s a convergence that could only be planned by God.", "            There is much coverage today of Bill and Hillarys emotional visit to Goree", Island, a slavery marshaling point off the coast of Senegal. Clinton paidtribute there to Americans descended from slaves brought from Africa. Everybody, "has Clintons shock at seeing the size of the iron ball used to immobilize", manacled slaves. But there is something consistently missing in all the Goreecoverage. While the island was owned at various times by each of the majorEuropean colonial powers active in West Africa, the LAT is wrong to describe it as the place "where millions ofAfricans ended their lives as free people and became captives of white mensending them across the ocean to an unknown future." What\s left out is thatduring the four centuries of the slave trade, most of the millions of Africansvictimized were first captured by other Africans and then sold to Europeans.They ended their lives as free people before they fell into white hands.            The LAT front reports that teen smoking is on the rise, jumping by nearly a third in the pastsix years. Especially alarming is the news of a big increase among blackteenagers, a group once believed to be curiously resistant to the teen smokingtrend. This story also makes the NYT front and is inside at theWP .            More on the rise of Sen. John McCain: The Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire" reports that he willpublish his memoirs in the presidential run-up year of 1999, and that an editorwho bid on the book says the excerpt he saw brought tears to his eyes.            "Hello\s Papers" appreciates the dozens and dozens of responses to therequest for a better term for the procedure often described in the papers as a"partial birth abortion." (Incidentally, there was no political agenda behindthe request--it was made purely out of an interest in increased linguisticprecision.) An FOTP coffee cup goes to James S. Thompson, M.D., of Newburyport,Massachusetts, for the simple but effective "partial delivery abortion." TPwill essay to use the phrase and commends it to the dailies.            And thanks to the many readers who rushed forward with considerable, "expertise to answer this columns somewhat inept question about the", NYT \s story concerning that fourth-grader\s "therapeutic touch"experiment. The upshot is that TP was mistaken in suggesting that a randomresult would have to be a 50 percent score. That would only be true with aninfinite number of trials. But in an actual experiment, which involves a finitenumber of trials, one calculates a range of values above and below 50% thatdefine what would still count as random results. This is the margin of error, "produced by the sample size. So since the kids result of 44 percent was within", that range for the number of trials she undertook, the NYT                wascorrect to say that her result was no better than chance. However, TP would addthis: the Times story, like all statistical stories, should havementioned the margin of error.            Back to Africa for a moment: If Steven Spielberg had tossed just a few more, "centi-Ks the DNCs way, Bill Clinton might have made this trip the week before", "Amistad" opened.                                                   Thanks--a Lott            USAT and the LAT lead with a Supreme Court decision placing new restrictions, "on credit union membership. The WP leads with Kenneth Starrs latest", "animadversions. And the NYT goes with Sen. Trent Lotts call for the rejection", of the Kofi Annan-brokered accord with Iraq.            The USAT , LAT and WSJ pieces (as well as a piece on the frontof the NYT national edition) explain that the credit union decisiondecides a simmering conflict between those organizations and banks in favor ofthe latter. Banks had been claiming that credit unions, which enjoy tax-exemptstatus based on their origins as volunteer-run cooperatives, have, by wildlyexpanding their memberships beyond simple company or vocational affiliation (71million members, more than double the 1991 total), been able to unfairlycompete for customers. Yesterday, by a 5-4 vote, the Court agreed, even though, "consumer advocates complain that this portends bad news for customers, whove", benefited from the downward fee pressures credit unions provide.            The LAT credit union effort attributes a quotation to "the AmericanBankers Assn. and four other banking groups." Not to a spokesman for thoseorganizations, but to the groups themselves. "Hello\s Papers" guesses this is atelltale sign of writing the reaction part of the story from a press release.It would be far better to interview an actual person instead, if only because, "you cant ask a press release follow-up questions.",             The WP lead reports that yesterday, Starr lashed out at the"avalanche of lies" spread about his staff and defended his decision tosubpoena Clinton loyalists to determine if they have been spreading derogatoryinformation about his office. Meanwhile, says the Post , his grand jury, "investigation focused on Monica Lewinskys federal job history, with a", potential wrangle over the possible invoking of executive privilege by certainsenior Clinton aides still on hold. The paper points out that the privilege, "issue presents Starr with a Hobsons choice: fight the notion and divert", "significant resources to a long court battle, or dont fight it and forgo some", key witnesses., "            The WP lead runs a new charge made by Monica Lewinskys lawyer", William Ginsburg: Linda Tripp may have "manipulated tape-recordedconversations" she had with his client. The paper doesn\t say whether thelawyer meant Tripp tricked ML into misstatements or physically edited the tapeto be misleading. It should have.            The Post does report that Lewinsky was offered [[$1]]0,000 seed money fora legal defense fund by a benefactor whose foundation promotes the view thatwomen need to "use their sexuality" in the workplace to attract mentors.            According to the NYT , it looks as if Trent Lott was able to takeenough of a break from sabotaging campaign reform to try sabotaging the newIraq deal. Lott, reports the Times , urged President Clinton to rejectit, accusing the administration of abdicating its foreign policy to Kofi Annan.The Times pointedly observes that "Lott did not say in his speechWednesday what he would have done if he were in the president\s position.."            The NYT front carries a chilling "special report" about the U.N., "weapons inspectors hunt for Iraqs germ warfare arsenal. The piece flatly", states that Iraq has run an elaborate germ weapons program and that it "hadmade enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on earth several timesover." There\s also the revelation of a crash military program intended to, "create the ability for Iraq to wipe out Israels population with anthrax", microbes.            The WP and LAT fronts describe how, within the past elevendays, computer hackers have broken into unclassified Pentagon networks toexamine and possibly alter payroll and personnel data., "            Sure, the school bus is crawling with safety violations and doesnt contain", seat belts and will be taking the kids to classrooms run by teachers who never, "actually had to take the subjects theyre teaching, but at least according to", the WSJ "Business Bulletin," in a few years there will besatellite-based technology available to families that will let them know to thesecond exactly when the bus is arriving.                                                   Bill Them Later            The LosAngeles Times leads with yet another congressional defeat of campaignreform legislation. The New YorkTimes goes with the latest on the Senate anti-smoking bill. USA Helloleads with a General Accounting Office finding that most FAA field inspectorsfeel their bosses ignore their safety recommendations. And the Washington Post leads with the filing of court papers by, "President Clintons lawyers that charge Paula Jones legal team with being a", "stalking horse" for Ken Starr and with trying to sabotage the case proceedingsby raising unproven salacious charges, such as, in its most recent filings, anunsubstantiated third-party version of a 20-year-old Clinton rape rumor.            The LAT says that prospects for enacting comprehensive campaign reform this year arepretty much dashed because on Monday the House leadership of Newt Gingrichand Dick Armey adopted rules requiring any such measure to pass, not by thesimple majority that seemed in the offing, but by a two-thirds"super-majority." The LAT reminds readers that the House\s commitment tothe issue dates from a much-publicized handshake deal Gingrich made withPresident Clinton in 1995. The paper quotes a California congressman as saying,"The process has been rigged. . . . What\s happening today is a real sham." Thecollapse of reform also makes the WP and NYT fronts.            This is the third time in recent months that campaign reform legislation hasfizzled. The headline, "GOP Leadership Defeats Campaign Reform Bill," isgetting to be right up there with "Extremist Group Claims Credit for Bombing"and "Union Officials Indicted in New Jersey.", "            Picking up where yesterdays USAT and WP leads left off, the", NYT lead explains that when, on Monday, Sen. John McCain officially, "unveiled the comprehensive tobacco bill hed been putting together, it was seen", to place no restrictions on private lawsuits against the tobacco companies,although it does contain an annual damage ceiling of [$6.5 billion ](awards inexcess of that amount would be owed in full, but could be carried forward tosubsequent years). In order to qualify though, reports the Wall Street Journal , tobacco manufacturers would have tomeet targets for reducing underage smoking and cut back on outdoor and cartoonadvertising. The Journal says the absence of a restriction on lawsuitswas a surprise to all sides. A tobacco industry lawyer is quoted in theNYT saying that the measure would lead to "a massive contraband market,"and would "almost certainly drive companies into bankruptcy." In theJournal , tobacco deal strategist Mississippi Attorney General MichaelMoore says industry types "think their stock prices are going to plummet." TheNYT says that despite such opposition, McCain has won substantialbacking on his committee. ("Hello\s Papers" can\t help but notice that McCain\sname is all over the dailies these days--besides his smoking bill, he is alsoone of the Senate\s chief advocates of banning "soft money." All in all,excellent issues to run for president on.)            The WSJ "Work Week" column is given over to a topic near and, "dear to TPs heart: working at night. The latest figures from the Bureau of", Labor Statistics indicate there are now 3.2 million folks on "graveyard", "full-time. And yes, its quiet and you can go to the cheap movies when youre", off, but according to the Journal , night workers are more susceptible toheart attacks, stomach troubles and depression. And 60 percent more likely toget a divorce.            An editorial in the WP notes that a full 30 years afterthe passage of the Fair Housing Act, whites are still far more likely to ownhomes, even controlling for wealth and income. The piece goes on to note thatin a recent study made in Washington, D.C., when 150 pairs of black and whitetesters who were matched in income contacted local lenders, they encounteredevidence of racial discrimination 41 percent of the time. Significantly, saysthe WP "the bias did not take the form of a simple \no\ that would show, "up as clearly discriminatory in records. Instead, lenders didnt return phone", "calls, didnt keep appointments, offered more expensive or inferior products or", made greater demands for credit information." The editorial endorses President, "Clintons budget request for an additional [$22 million ]to combat housing", discrimination. A large chunk of that money will, says the paper, go towardstesters.            An obvious but politically incorrect fact underlying the Kathleen Willeybrouhaha is that the main reason she got a one-on-one meeting with Clinton inthe first place was probably that she was a woman. If a man has to meet with, "someone to accomplish a given task hed just as soon that the someone have", breasts and smell nice. Women know this and take full advantage. (And why, "shouldnt they?) Witness the WP , which reports that Andie MacDowell is meeting with Reps. Dick Gephardt and", John Dingell to lobby for more stringent oil pipeline regulations for westernMontana, where she happens to own a home. Guys, you try getting thatmeeting.                                                   Desert Storm Warnings                           USAHello and the New York, "Times lead with a federal judges ruling that the line-item veto is", "unconstitutional. The Washington Post leads with the Russian defense ministers", face-to-face rebuke of the U.S. Defense Secretary over Iraq. The top nationalstory at the Los Angeles Times is the unhappiness among many, "congressional Republicans about Newt Gingrichs decision to handle the Lewinsky", scandal by saying nothing critical of President Clinton.            According to the WP lead, in their Moscow meeting, Igor Sergeyevforcefully lectured William Cohen right in front of reporters about how Americawas being too tough on Iraq, and warned that future U.S.-Russian relations maybe affected. The paper reports that Cohen kept his cool. Also, the Post, "reports that Cohen asked Sergeyev about yesterdays allegations in the", WP about a 1995 agreement by Russia to sell Iraq equipment that could beused to develop biological weapons. The Russians issued a carefully wordeddenial.            The Post portrays the recent diplomacy undertaken by Russia inconnection with the Iraq flare-up as providing it with a chance to take on a, "global role it hasnt had since the Soviet collapse. And indeed, Cohen left the", meeting with the latest Russian proposal for softening U.N. weapons inspectionsof Iraq. Russian-U.S. tensions over Iraq also get front-page space atUSAT , the LAT and the WSJ .            The NYT describes the line-item veto veto as "a major blow" (randomchoice of words?) to President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders.The decision sets the stage, says the paper, for a ruling on the matter by theSupreme Court.            The Times reports that although the LIV is often defended as a toolfor fiscal restraint, even the Clinton administration attributes to it only [[$1]]Min direct deficit reduction.            The USAT front section "cover story" does a very able job ofcovering the geopolitical and especially military nuances facing any U.S. move, "against Iraq. The paper points out that, of course, this time there isnt", "nearly the amount of international support for military action. And its", "suggested that the current goal of thwarting Saddams ability to wage chemical", "and biological warfare is far more nebulous than 1991s objective of throwing", Saddam out of Kuwait.            But on the other hand, says the paper, U.S. smart bombs have gotten, "smarter--theyre now less likely to be distracted by smoke or bad weather-- and", there will be a lot more of them now. And now almost every plane in thegathering U.S. air arsenal can launch them.            This story has a surprising, even disconcerting amount of order of battleinformation ("The six F-117 Stealth fighters stationed nearby in Kuwait.").Also, the piece makes the point that still seven years after Desert Storm,there is no ideal bomb in the inventory that can reliably destroy bio-chemicalweapons plants while keeping poisons from getting into the atmosphere, whichmeans that true precision will be needed to avoid large numbers of civiliancasualties. Another obstacle noted is that it is impossible to destroy all thecomputer disks holding "cookbooks" for making chemical and biologicalweapons.            A couple of questions about the story however: The paper says that the B-2stealth bomber is a "stealth design like the F-117" stealth fighter, just muchbigger. But actually, the former employs smooth curves to bend radar waveswhile the latter uses flat, jagged edges to scatter them. And USAT saysthat the only U.S. jet capable of dropping a 5,000 lb. "bunker-busting bomb" is, "missing from the roster being formed over there. But doesnt explain why. The", NYT front-page piece, by ex-Marine Gen. Bernard Trainor, on the U.S.military plan, says that the 5,000 pounders will be used.            According to the Wall Street Journal "Washington Wire," Clinton advisorBruce Lindsey had a phone conversation last summer with.Linda Tripp. His, "purpose: to find out more about Kathleen Willeys allegations of sexual", harassment by Clinton.            "Hello\s Papers" appreciates all its sharp-eyed grammarian readers and willpress on irregardless of its occasional missteps.            The NYT features a sprawling op-ed by Tom Clancy called "Know the Answers BeforeGoing to War." In it, Clancy states that we don\t seem to have the answers to, "very many of the questions relevant to attacking Iraqs chemical and biological", "warfare capabilities. This is interesting, because in Clancys novels the U.S.", invariably has all the answers, and its weapons perform as required. So maybethe questions he proliferates here (here, unlike in his books, he questions thenotion of a "surgical" strike, and here he wonders, "Who has told us that it isOK to kill women and children?") are signs of a long-deferred maturity. Butmore likely is that this is anti-Clinton blather from a conservativeRepublican. After all, in this piece the car-home-and-fire salesman turnedglobal strategist describes the Gulf War as if it were a model of Clausewitzianclarity concerning ultimate goals and acceptable means, forgetting in theprocess that at the end of that war, the Bush/Powell/Schwarzkopf axisinternally disagreed about war issues that had never been articulated for theAmerican people: Should the U.S. destroy the Iraqi military, invade Baghdad, ortopple Hussein even after Iraq was repulsed from Kuwait? Because of thathistory, the American people have now given such matters much more thought.                                                   Organ-ized Crime?            The U.S. reaction to the U.N.-brokered Iraq deal is the consensus top story.The papers report that President Clinton gave his tentative OK to it, but alsothat he will keep the built-up U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region to make, "sure Iraq keeps up its end. Its also noted all around that in his remarks", yesterday, Clinton reserved the right to respond in the "manner of our ownchoosing" to any Iraqi breach of the new accord.            The actual details of the deal are still somewhat unclear, but it hasemerged that the U.N. weapons inspectors will be accompanied by diplomats--asyet unidentified-- in their tours of the disputed Iraqi presidential sites. TheWashington Post reports that some U.S. and U.N.officials said that the proposed arrangement implicitly supports the Iraqicritique of the original inspection set-up. But perhaps more telling, the paper, "also reports that the presidents senior advisors expressed relief at the", last-minute veer away from an air war. And that includes military advisors, oneof whom is quoted, "We had a tough time seeing where this was going to takeus."            In a New York Timesfront-page "news analysis" piece, R.W. Apple states that Clinton didn\t havemuch choice about the U.N. deal because he was unwilling from the start tocontemplate a campaign that would drive Hussein from power, but only one thatwould make him submit to U.N. authority.            The Times has the most reporting on the domestic political reactionto the deal, stating that some Republicans charge that Clinton has abdicatedthe making of foreign policy to the U.N., and that the general mood in Congresswas caution and skepticism. Trent Lott is quoted as being concerned that theadministration had "subcontracted its foreign policy to [the U.N.\s Kofi]Annan." Surprisingly, Newt Gingrich said he didn\t have those qualms.Democratic Senator John Kerry articulates the central worry: "How do we avoidthis ratcheting up on an annual basis?"            The WP front reports that Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed White Houseadviser Sidney Blumenthal to appear before a grand jury to answer questionsabout any role he might have had in disseminating negative information aboutStarr\s staff to reporters. The paper says the subpoena is "particularly broad"and signals "an escalation in the battle between the White House and theindependent counsel." The NYT says Blumenthal was incensed and also thathe accuses Starr of leaking his subpoena to the media.            The NYT front reports that an FBI undercover operation in New York,prompted by a tip from celebrated Chinese exiled dissident Harry Wu, hasproduced the arrest of two men for trying to sell organs from the bodies ofexecuted Chinese prisoners. Allegedly, it was eye corneas at [[[$5,000 ]]]a pair, andkidney transplants for [[$20],000 ]plus. Also in the offing apparently werepancreases, livers, lungs and skin. The WP runs its organs-for-salestory inside, pointing out that one of the arrested men said that he could, "guarantee skin from young prisoners and lungs from ones who didnt smoke.", Provided that the "donors" in question are legitimately tried and executed,neither piece, it seems, really makes it clear exactly why this practice isinherently deplorable. After all, the Post notes, the U.S. suffers froman acute shortage of organs for transplant.            The Wall Street Journal "Work Week" column reports that aresearcher has found that despite worker assumptions to the contrary, childlessemployees do not work longer hours than their colleagues raising kids., "            Does Mary Bono, Sonnys widow, believe in good old-fashioned conservative", family values? The WP reports that Ms. Bono has left her newlyfatherless seven-year-old and nine-year-old in school back in California whileshe came to Washington to raise money for her campaign to win her late, "husbands congressional seat. Does the prospect of even lengthier absences,", should she win, daunt her? Well, Bono says, "Congress is in recess often enoughwhere I could be [with the children in Palm Springs] for weeks at a time."

The Los AngelesTimes leads with Madeleine Albright seeking a tough stance on Serbianviolence in Yugoslavia. And the New York Timesgoes with drawing the basic Capitol Hill battle lines regarding the upcomingsurplus budget. The Times says a rift has opened between HouseRepublicans, who continue to aggressively opt for tax cuts, and SenateRepublicans, who are more apt to go along with the basic thrust of the Clintonbudget plan.            The death of McDougal on Sunday, of a heart attack in the prison where hewas serving his Whitewater sentence, is widely viewed as trouble for Ken Starr.USAT says it means the end for Starr of a steady stream of information, "on the Clintons business and political activities. The LAT front-page", McDougal piece says his death could be a "setback." USAT calls McDougala "dashing eccentric." The WP calls him a "wily Arkansas bankingrogue."            Everybody quotes President Clinton\s statement of condolence: "I have goodmemories of the years we worked together in Arkansas, and I extend mycondolences to his family." The USAT and the WP (in its "Style"section profile) mention that the White House statement notably lacked anyexpression of sympathy from Hillary Clinton. The Post says there is aMcDougal book on the way titled "Arkansas Mischief.", "            Last Fridays NYT lead set out the meaning of the WP s Clinton", "deposition scoop from the day before: that the presidents secretary, Betty", Currie, had become the central character in his accounts of all his dealingswith Monica Lewinsky. It apparently took several days for that to sink in at, "the Post , where todays lead makes essentially the same point. The papers", quotes this gender- and religion-confused defense of Currie offered by JesseJackson: "Betty Currie isn\t a lone gunman shooting from the hips....She is a, "government servant and a Christian woman....It isnt like Betty to be making", independent decisions of her own volition."            The LAT lead states that on the eve of a six nation conference inLondon, Albright is pushing European allies to act decisively to end the recentoutbreak of violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The paper notes that, "France may balk at punitive measures directed against Serbia. The NYT s", veteran war correspondent Chris Hedges provides detailed reporting on the ground from Prekaz in Kosovo province.Hedges says there were clear indications the town saw heavy combat, indicating, "that the Albanian side was not unarmed. Hedges dispatch includes the harrowing", tale of an Albanian woman who fled Prekaz with her five children after herhusband was killed.                           USAT has a brief front-page blurb and the WP has a more, "detailed piece based on the report in this weeks Time that the FBI and", State Department are investigating the theft, during the height of the Iraqcrisis, by a man in a brown tweed jacket, of top secret documents from a secure, "State Dept. office just down the hall from Albrights. So far, the papers", report that authorities suspect an inside job.            The Wall Street Journal \s main "Politics and Policy" piecestates that based on recent White House performances, "the Clinton legal teamclearly is calling the shots in the Lewinsky flap, and its strategy is simple:the less said, the better." In the piece, Dee Dee Myers joins fellow Clintonalum George S. in dumping on the White House: "Throughout the Clintonpresidency, even times when I was there, the White House has created theappearance of wrongdoing by being slow to come forward with the facts."

And the Los Angeles Times leads with another in its series, "of important stories on the L.A.

Kofi Annan was, says USAT , to be in Washington today to meet withPresident Clinton and "bask in praise for ending the threat of war with Iraq."But, U.N. officials told the paper, he postponed his trip after Sen. TrentLott, who last week harshly criticized the deal Annan brokered with Iraq, said, "he didnt have time to meet with him. (Idea for editors: report on Lotts", schedule for this week. It would be interesting to see how many fundraisers andmeetings with lobbyists he manages to fit in.)            The WP lead notes that on weekend yap shows, White House advisor RahmEmmanuel and Sen. Patrick Leahy called on Starr to wind up Whitewater, and thatthree Republican senators also expressed guarded criticism of him. Emmanuelstopped short of saying Starr should resign, but Leahy said, "Sure he should,"adding that he is "totally out of control." The paper reports that over the, "weekend Arlen Specter, John McCain and Orrin Hatch each questioned Starrs", calling in Sidney Blumenthal to question him in front of a grand jury about hispress contacts. The idea that Starr has blown it is explored in a large pieceinside the Times and was also the subject of an LAT front-pageron Sunday.            The NYT notes that the transportation bill before the Senate is sucha big challenge to the balanced budget because it provides goodies to everycongressional district in the country. The piece points out that among those, "who want to make sure the bill doesnt eat into any budget surplus is Newt", Gingrich. The Times also notes that the bill raises several partisanside issues that could lead to a confrontation with the White House, namely,proposals to delay new clean air regulations, scale back affirmative actionhiring on highway projects, and lower wage levels for transportation projectworkers.            The Wall Street Journal front page tells the story of how fouryears after the FAA announced its intent to create a [$500 million ]system forallowing commercial aircraft to use military Global Positioning satellites fornavigation, the system is nowhere near in place. In fact, says theJournal , the system might end up costing [[$1]]4 billion. And the FAA wouldhave to keep paying for the current, conventional system until every airlinehad switched over.

But the papers off-lead is probably the", bigger story: The earthquake hazard facing Southern California may only be half, "as great as scientists had been saying, and its very unlikely that the region", will ever experience that staple of Los Angeles small talk, the 8.0 quake, akaThe Big One.                           USAT reports that Clinton has asked HHS Secretary Donna Shalala tolook into strengthening a 1996 law aimed at helping people between jobs keeptheir health coverage. The main problem, says the paper, is that the law, "doesnt control how much companies can charge for such gap coverage, so they", are tending to make it prohibitive.            Following up on the USAT lead from just over a week ago, theWP lead reports that oil prices have gone down into the [[$1]]3 a barrelneighborhood, a true boon to the U.S. economy. Adjusted for inflation, this isthe lowest price since the energy crisis in the 1970s. The reasons given arethe same ones offered in the papers last week: a mild winter here and in, "Europe, a slowdown in Asian demand and the unwillingness by two of OPECs", biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, to cut production. A bit furtherbelow in the story is the reason for that: they are trying to gain market sharevia low prices.            The Senate Budget Committee proposed a Republican fiscal blueprint that,, "says the NYT , rejects nearly all of President Clintons calls for", increased spending in such areas as education, child care and health care,choosing instead to put the proceeds of any tobacco settlement into Medicare.But on the other hand, the budget plan provides smaller tax cuts than were, "sought by many Republicans, and supports the Clinton administrations plan to", use budget surpluses to first shore up Social Security. The Times saysthe proposal is likely to be adopted more or less intact.

The WP and LAT note that Habibies pronouncements", came just one day before the International Monetary Fund is due to beginnegotiating terms for release of the latest installment of a stalled [$43]billion bailout package.            The Post says that the military is strongly supporting reform. TheLAT says that Habibie does not enjoy military support and that thesemoves appear to ensure that he will be an "interim figure."            A NYT front-page story reports that the Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo,whose members have been implicated in the twelve-fatality nerve gassing of theTokyo subway in 1995, had previously conducted numerous biological warfare attacks inJapan. Using rooftops and truck convoys, the group conducted, concludes theTimes , at least nine germ attacks on such targets as the JapaneseLegislature, the Imperial Palace, and the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka., "Hearteningly, the attacks failed because the terrorists couldnt obtain or", produce germs of sufficient virulence. Dishearteningly, neither Japanese norAmerican authorities--including the U.S. Navy or the CIA--detected any ofthem.            On the WP front, ace political reporter David Broder checks in fromCalifornia to report that Prop. 226, which would require unions to get annualpermission from individual members to make any political use of dues, is,despite a commanding early lead in the polls, now sinking fast. The mainreason, Broder reports, seems to be the huge amount of money--nearly [$20], "million--unions have poured into anti-226 ads. Doesnt this kind of turnaround", "power of union spending pretty much drive home 226s point?",             The Wall Street Journal reports that, according to Manpower, "Inc.s latest employment-outlook survey, nearly a third of U.S. businesses", intend to increase staffing in the third quarter. The paper quotes the glossprovided by Manpower\s chairman: "There has never been a job market even closeto this.", "            OK, OK, so you already know its just about impossible to get any Viagra.", "But thats in this country. What about, wonders an LAT front-pager, the", rest of the world? The paper turns up a [$42 ]bottle of the stuff in a Mexico, "City market, but its counterfeit. In Taiwan, the real thing goes for [$60 ]bucks", a pill on the black market. And in Turkey, the under-the-table price is up to[$800 ]a bottle. But, says the LAT , Viagra is legal in SanMarino--however, the place has been overrun by would-be Italian stallions, so, "good luck finding any. In a world of lurid myopia, its refreshing to see that", a paper is still willing to put seven staffers on an overseas story.                                                   House Call                           USAHello leads with the tough prison sentence given to an ex-aide to MikeEspy and what it might mean to the dramatis personae of the Clinton sexscandal. The Washington Post leads with word that Newt Gingrich andHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde agreed yesterday to form a small, "group of House members that would check to see if Kenneth Starrs investigation", has accumulated evidence of an impeachable offense. The national edition of theNew York Timesgoes with the conclusion by a panel of educational experts that bothold-fashioned phonics and new-fashioned "whole-language" methods are valuablefor teaching reading. The metro edition of the Times leads with theunanimous decision by the New York City Board of Education to requireelementary school kids to wear uniforms. The top national story in the metro, "edition is the presidents criticism of the GOP budget. The Los Angeles", Times lead continues the close look the paper has been taking lately atlocal and state prisons. On the heels of indictments of prison officials inconnection with an inmate death at Corcoran prison, the paper reports thatfederal investigators are now looking into assaults and slayings of inmates attwo other state facilities.            The judge in the Espy aide case ignored the sentencing guidelinerecommendation of probation to hand down a 27-month sentence for lying, andwhile doing so, referred darkly to a "Hollywood" lawyer and others who have, "suggested that lying under oath in a civil case isnt a big deal. USAT", implies the "Hollywood" tag was meant to refer to Monica Lewinsky\s LosAngeles-based lawyer, William Ginsburg. The paper concludes the judge wanted to"send a message to key players in the White House intern scandal." The sentenceis also covered inside at the WP .            According to the Post , the House select group agreed to by Gingrich and Hyde would, "include Democrats and will probably examine Starrs evidence at Starrs office", to avoid the leaky consequences of the House of Representatives rule makingmaterial in the files of any standing committee available to any member.            The NYT reports that President Clinton used sharply partisan languagein knocking the Republican budget before a cheering,sympathetic crowd of AFL-CIO members in Las Vegas, saying it "shortchanges ournation\s future," by eliminating his new initiatives on education, job trainingand child care. Meanwhile, back in Washington, reports the Times , theSenate Budget Committee approved the Republican tax and spending plan on astraight party-line vote, after defeating several Democratic attempts toreinstate the Clinton initiatives. The Clinton speech also gets front space atthe WP .            The Wall Street Journal "Business Bulletin" reports that ittakes about six years for a new consumer product to take off. That probablyseems long to investors, but, says the Journal , before World War II ittook about eighteen years.            A Clinton White House executive order from a few years back requires the CIAand other government agencies to release every classified document in the, "archives thats more than 25 years-old. A WSJ front-page feature", "visits the CIA facility thats doing the declassification", "work, editing out sensitive information line by line. And its a lot of", "work--there are 65 million pages to review. Wheres the facility? Thats a", secret .            Right now, the press is in a big respectability-puffing, nose-holding phasein its reporting of the Clinton sex scandals, deploring--in exquisitedetail--having to cover all that executive branch breastage and groinage. Agood clue to how insincere that all is comes in a letter to the WP . "The press coverage of MonicaLewinsky and her problems," a reader notes, "has mentioned little or nothingabout the [White House] intern program in which she was employed." Here at last, "is a legitimate story related to the scandals thats not itself salacious--so", "of course, it hasnt been done.",                                                    Nuclear Pakistandoff            Everybody leads with the expected, but still earthshaking, first Pakistani, "nuclear blasts. A measure of the events significance is that the New York Times ,", Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes each go with two front-page bomb stories. The LAT andWP feature big above-the-fold pictures of jubilant Pakistanis. The, "NYT front features instead a shot of Pakistans Prime Minister Nawaz", Sharif walking alongside his army chief, both men grim-faced.            The Pakistanis claim to have set off five explosions, although USA Hello andWP reports that the U.S. confirmed only one. (The NYT says "asfew as two.") But, according to USAT , the LAT and theTimes , U.S. officials are concerned that there will soon be at least onemore Pakistani atomic blast. And Pakistan announced, says the WP andNYT , that it is already fitting nuclear warheads on its long-rangemissiles. The LAT quotes an expert saying that this missile claim may bemore a statement of intent than fact. And the LAT is likewise consolingelsewhere in its reporting, quoting three experts to the effect that India andPakistan may not henceforth feel the need to match each other weapon forweapon.            President Clinton made an eleventh-hour attempt to head all this off with aphone call to Sharif late Wednesday. (And the WP reports that the, "Chinese, the source of most of the Pakistanis atomic know-how, also tried", "getting them to stop the tests.) But Sharifs announcement of the", explosions--"Hello, we have settled the score with India"--shows what Clintonwas up against. The LAT says that among Pakistanis there was "intense,nearly unanimous" support for testing an atomic weapon. The NYT reports that in the hours just prior to conducting the, "tests, Pakistan summoned Indias diplomatic envoy and accused India of planning", "a pre-emptive military strike on Pakistans atomic testing center.",             In response to the A-blasts, under the same automatic provision of U.S. lawthat kicked in on India, Clinton moved to cancel all U.S. aid to Pakistan (only[$4 ]million) and more significantly, to oppose all international loans. ThePakistani government, the papers report, made an economic move of its own: tokeep money from fleeing the country, it froze all foreign currency accounts., "But the sanctions will hurt--after all, as the NYT observes, the globes", newest open nuclear power is also one of its ten poorest countries. TheWall Street Journal sees the sudden Asian nuke-out(along with the China satellite flap) as eclipsing the dominant business-drivenforeign policy approach of the nineties, and returning security and moralconsiderations to the diplomatic fore., "            Everybodys front has the latest Ken Starr move: his attempt to bypass the federal appeals process and go right to the", Supreme Court for a definitive ruling on executive privilege as it applies tothe Lewinsky case. (The NYT makes the least of the story, merely puttinga "reefer" to it on the bottom right front.) The rare tactic, says USAT ,caught the White House by surprise. But, the papers note, it was used, "successfully by Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworksi to pry Nixons Oval", Office tapes from of his hands.            The WSJ states that a special government report to be released next, "week will criticize the CIAs failure to anticipate Indias atomic tests.", "According to the report, the oops wasnt primarily technical--it was human.",             The WP brings word that NEC will shortly become the first PCmanufacturer to take advantage of a recent legal settlement between Microsoftand the DOJ by offering Windows 95 but no desktop icon for Internet Explorer. Instead, IE andNetscape Navigator will both merely be supplied on a CD-ROM., "            Well, if smoking can reduce breast cancer, its only fair that, according to", the NYT front, catalytic converters have been found by the EPA to be asignificant cause of global warming. Add this to such eco-perversions (noted byGregg Easterbrook) as: logging, acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer allappear to reduce global warming.            The WP runs an editorial today calling for a vote against Prop. 226, the, "California ballot measure requiring unions to get a members permission before", "political expenditures can be drawn from his or her dues. Whats wrong, says", the Post , is that such a restriction does not likewise constraincorporate political contributions. The NYT comes out against 226 too, and for the same reason. Butthe Times is open to a bilateral version in which labor unions must getpermission for political spending from individual workers and corporations mustdo so from individual shareholders. Such an "evenhanded approach," says theTimes , "could reduce the amount of special-interest money sluicing intoboth parties and help diminish the corroding influence of bigcontributions."                                                   Willey, Adversary                           USAHello and the Washington Post lead with the grand jury appearance ofKathleen Willey. The New YorkTimes covers the Willey questioning in its lead too, but goes higher inthe story with the news that President Clinton may be headed for a grand juryappearance himself. The Los Angeles Times leads with the news that the INSannounced that none of a new batch of Border Patrol agents is being assigned toSan Diego--because the agency feels that illegal immigration there has "reacheda level of control." The paper notes that some Southern Californians, including, "some area politicians, dispute this, noting that while San Diegos illegal", entries seem to have dropped, nearby areas of inland California have seen theirillegal immigration arrests skyrocket., "            Yesterdays WP said that Willey was coming to the Starr grand jury,", but nobody predicted this soon. The papers seize on various indications that inWilley, Starr seems to have at last found a cooperative witness, noting thatshe did not appear to have her own lawyer with her ( USAT ), that shearrived in a Starr van (the WP ), and was accompanied inside thecourthouse by prosecutors (the WP and NYT ). The WP notes the White House projected an air ofunconcern, quoting spokesman Joe Lockhart\s comment: "When people tell thetruth, they tell the truth. It doesn\t matter who drove you there." But thePost also notes that the White House was mum about how Willey, aclerical volunteer, managed to wangle the private appointment in November, 1993, "with Clinton to discuss her husbands financial troubles and her sudden need", for a job, during which, she charges in her Jones case deposition, he gropedher., "            The Post observes that Willeys appearance indicates Starr is", widening his investigation beyond the allegations involving Monica Lewinsky todetermine whether President Clinton has testified truthfully in his Paula Jonesdeposition about other women as well. Everybody reports that Starr is alsointerested in determining if Willey was--as she stated in her Jones caseaffidavit--approached by Democratic fund-raiser Nathan Landow in an effort toinfluence her to back off her grope charge.            It has been widely reported that a woman named Julie Steele now says Willeyasked her to falsely claim that she was told by Willey about the incident notlong after it happened. But USAT says that it has found another Willey friendwho says Willey told her of the incident shortly after it allegedly took place.On the other hand, the paper also notes that in her 1995 testimony in, "connection with a lawsuit over her late husbands estate, Willey says she never", "had a conversation with anyone in Washington about her husbands financial", reversals.            The NYT front reports that sixIraqis who worked with the CIA in plots against Saddam Hussein have nowbeen declared threats to U.S. national security and hence subject to, "deportation, in a ruling so secret that their lawyers arent allowed to read", it.            Another Times front-page piece describes how fear of litigation hasmade high school guidance counselors much more hesitant to passalong information about applicants to college admissions personnel. "They\llwrite that Johnny took these courses and was a great student," remarks oneexpert in the field, "but they won\t tell you that Johnny burned down thegym."            The Wall Street Journal "Tax Report" says that the number oftax cases referred to the Justice Department in which taxpayers have simplyrefused to recognize the basic legality of the income tax has doubled over thepast three years., "            And the Journal s piece about the upcoming Blumenthal vs. Drudge libel suit quotes First Amendment", scholar Floyd Abrams as saying, "If one were rewriting libel law today, onewould try to write it to assure that the false statements of Matt Drudge weretreated as libel." And what exactly would that rewrite say? You know, that, "wouldnt allow Matt Drudge to say what he says, but would allow Floyd Abrams to", say what he says.            The WP reports that according to a new GAO report, in 1995-96, [$8.5]million worth of food stamps were issued to more than 25,000 dead people.            Both the NYT and WP report that when asked to identify himselfby reporters in front of the courthouse where the Starr grand jury is located,Kathleen Willey\s son said he was "the sausage king of Chicago." The, "Times is stumped by this, but the Post gets it: hes quoting a", line Matthew Broderick used in "Ferris Bueller\s Day Off."                                                   Missilany            The New York, "Times s top national story is that despite three years of contrary", assurances to the U.S., Russia is helping India build a nuclear missile. The, "Washington Post s top national story is an account", of how, fifteen years and [$50 billion] after Ronald Reagan\s "Star Wars" speech,, "the U.S. still doesnt have an anti-ballistic-missile defense system. The", Los, "Angeles Times goes with the Clinton administrations decision to oppose", the California ballot referendum measure calling for an end to publicly fundedbilingual education, a measure thought to be favored by 70 percent of the, "states voters. USA Hello leads with Defense Secretary William Cohens", warning to Congress that failure to approve an emergency spending bill and anew round of base closings will mean big layoffs of Pentagon civilians andfewer high-tech weapons.            According to the Times , in 1995 Russian officials told the U.S. that, "its help on the Indian missile project was limited, and didnt", involve the missile design. In return, the Clinton administration cleared theway for American/Russian cooperation in space. However, U.S. intelligencereports have continued to suggest a bigger Russian role. The Times, "points out that Russias technical assistance raises fears of a stepped-up arms", race between India and Pakistan, against whom India has fought three wars, andwhich has just tested a nuclear-capable missile of its own.            The WP reports that out of twenty intercept tests in the past decade,only seven anti-missile missiles struck their targets. Since thelast success in 1994, there have been six straight failures. While the Clintonadministration has not committed to deploying a national anti-missile shield,under pressure from the GOP (national missile defense was a tenet of the"Contract With America"), it has promised to accelerate testing. But, the paperreports, only one actual flight trial of the entire system is planned beforethe administration must decide whether or not to place it in operation.            According to a big USAT investigative piece, two years after theValuJet crash, airline passengers are still being endangered by improperlylabeled or packaged hazardous materials on their flights. For the story,USAT shipped unmarked boxes with six different courier services andthree of them did not do what FAA rules require: ask for a photo ID and adeclaration that the boxes were free of hazardous goods. Although the FAA seems, "to be catching more violators, the paper quotes one of the agencys top", officials saying, "We wouldn\t know whether hazardous materials are inside if apackage doesn\t leak or break open."            The Wall Street Journal \s main "Politics and Policy" piece saysthat Asia views as smart the U.S. economic strategy of getting the IMF to come, "in with rescue packages that dont directly cost the U.S. that much. And hence", "if Congress defeats the Clinton administrations proposal to pony up [[[$1]]8]", billion for the IMF, the Asian economic players will be at least confused andpossibly hostile., "            The NYT reports the latest sign of the Mafias decline: according to federal", experts, the "Commission," the mob\s equivalent to the U.N. Security Council,where deals between New York\s five "families" were made and disputes ironed, "out, hasnt met in almost two years. Why? Convictions and indictments of top", mobsters have created chronic uncertainty about who can speak for the variousfamilies as well as increased concerns about exposure at meetings to informersand undercover police officers., "            Sundays NYT front had a home run piece by Jill Abramson detailing", the current investigation fad in Washington, along the way coining a goodphrase for it. There are currently, Abramson reported, 31 separate officialinquiries into reported wrongdoing by Bill Clinton, members of hisadministration or figures in the Democratic Party. Not to mention all thelawyers, PIs and journalists this entails. "Washington has become," she writes,"the center of a scandal-industrial complex." The piece also carried this quotefrom Clinton staffer James E. Kennedy in response to congressional complaintsabout the number of White House lawyers working to defend Clinton: "It\s likean arsonist complaining about the size of the fire department." Kennedy, by theway, is termed "the White House scandal spokesman.", "            Never let it be said that the WP doesnt kick you when youre down.", In its "Style" section debrief of Saturday night\s star-studded White HouseCorrespondents\ Dinner, the paper says that "Dick Cavett was there, trying toremember which year he was the dinner\s featured entertainer."

Dan Burton for his release of the Web Hubbell prison tapes.The New York Times, "leads with Washington states anti-affirmative action ballot initiative. And", the Los, "Angeles Times goes with Israels rejection of an American proposal for", a transfer of more West Bank land to the Palestinians.            The two new cancer drugs work, explains USAT , by cutting off theblood supply to tumors, making it impossible for them to grow. Used together,they have eradicated tumors in mice. Which is why they are scheduled for humantrials. But, says the paper, the leap from mouse to man is a huge one.            The WP lead details how Rep. Burton was accused onSunday by congressional Democrats and White House staffers of doctoring, "transcripts of Hubbells prison phone conversations. The material Burton", "released appears to describe Hubbells decision to continue to protect Bill and", Hillary Clinton out of fears that his wife would lose her government job, but,, "notes the Post , does not include Hubbells statement that Hillary", Clinton had "no idea" of billing irregularities at their law firm, or hisassertion that he was not being paid hush money.            Another dispute centers on Hubbell\s lawyer saying on the tape, "There issome chance that the day after Election Day they will make a move that mootseverything. And I don\t want to discourage it." According to the Post ,, "Burton says this was a reference to a presidential pardon, but Hubbells lawyer", says it was an immunity deal--eventually granted--with Ken Starr. TheNYT hits the pardon issue much higher in its front page Hubbell tapestory, not surprising since it went front page on Saturday with a story sayingcongressional investigators took the "Election Day" comment to signify pardonhopes.            The Times lead points out that referenda rather thanlegislation may increasingly become the main tool of the anti-affirmative, "action movement, because while Californias Prop. 209 won decisively, the bills", introduced in its wake in 13 states were all defeated. The story also scoreshow Washington state business heavyweights line up on the ballot initiative:Boeing and Nordstrom are against, and Microsoft is expected to stayneutral.            The LAT front story on Japan\s current economic woes runs under: "TaxCut May Not Spur Yen to Spend in Japan." Do we really need to see this "clever"use of "yen" in a headline ever, ever again?            The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is warning WallStreet analysts that federal and state legal anti-trust suits against thecompany\s introduction of Windows 98 could have "broad, negative consequences"for the entire personal computer industry if they cause that new software to bedelayed.            The Journal \s "The Outlook" piece takes note of recent claims thatthe Y2K problem will generate a recession of 1974 oil-shock caliber and says, "thats not likely: After all, the twenty-two-day-long government shut-down in", "1996 didnt do that, nor did last summers UPS strike.",             A WP editorial calling on Congress to close moremilitary bases supports the cause with some simple observations: While thenumber of Navy ships is down nearly 46 percent, its berthing space is down only18 percent, and while Army troop strength is down 42 percent, trainingfacilities for soldiers are down only 7 percent. Since, Congress will probablykeep total military spending flat, the paper notes that not closing bases isequivalent to passing cuts on readiness, weapons procurement and research.            According to the WSJ , representatives of some computer companies andof Microsoft are expected to stage a pro-MS rally Tuesday.

And it has legs. And pants. And a zipper.            Kenneth Starr has finally found a way to make Arkansas real estate sexy. Inwhat USAHello calls a "rapidly escalating inquiry" into allegations thatPresident Clinton had an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, andtold her to lie about it to authorities, Starr yesterday subpoenaed White House, "documents, including, says USAT , logs on Lewinskys comings and goings.", The dailies all report that Clinton emphatically denies the allegations. TheLosAngeles Times goes further, saying the president is "infuriated" bythem.            The story was first broken by late editions of yesterday\s Washington Post and LAT . ("Hello\s Papers" wascastigated by numerous readers for having poor news judgment, or worse, apro-Clinton desire to suppress news. The truth is much simpler: the story washeld out of the early editions of the papers this column is written from.)Hello, the Post slops the most at the trough, with nine different Monicamissives.            What gives the tale what the Post calls a "Watergate-like intensity"is the news that Starr purportedly has at least 20 hours of tape recordings ofLewinsky telling a fellow federal worker, Linda Tripp, about her alleged affair, "and about Clintons and Vernon Jordans cover-up instructions. (Lewinsky signed", an affidavit on January 7 in which she denied any sexual relationship withClinton.) Tripp made most of the secretly recorded tapes on her own. But thelast one in the collection was made with the assistance of the FBI, which setup a monitored rendezvous between the two women a little over a week ago at,says the WP , an Arlington, Virginia hotel bar. Starr used these tapes to, "get Janet Reno and the federal judges who manage Starrs activities to broaden", his net to its current gaping dimensions. (And further investigation is, "required: As USAT points out, any of Lewinskys statements on tape about", what was said to her are hearsay and probably inadmissible.)            The WP and New YorkTimes say Clinton denied a sex relationship with Lewinsky in his PaulaJones case deposition last weekend. But the Post says he did testify, "that hed given Lewinsky personal gifts. (The paper also oh-by-the-ways that", Clinton acknowledged under oath for the first time that he did indeed have anaffair with Gennifer Flowers.)            The WP relies heavily in its reporting on a source it says has heardthe tapes. It quotes that source as saying the recordings include "graphicdescriptions of sexual encounters." The NYT says that the tapes alsocontain "tearful passages." The paper reports that Tripp also told Starr\speople about telephone answering machine messages containing a voice sounding, "like Clintons. The NYT elaborates: the messages were played by Ms.", Lewinsky to Ms. Tripp, who surreptitiously taped them. The Times also, "reports that a New York literary agent, a friend of Tripps, has possession of", two of the tapes, which the agent describes as "shocking beyond belief."            Not surprisingly, given its historical squeamishness and the fact that itwas scooped, the NYT holds back a bit. But surprisingly, William Safire, "writes that he cant believe the charges, and hopes we can get past them", "quickly to the countrys real business: making peace in the Middle East,", "kicking Saddams ass and...pillorying Bill Clinton in connection with all the", other scandals. (Re Saddam: note that the Clinton administration is nowconfronted with a serious "Wag the Dog" problem: any strong action takenagainst Saddam may be construed in the media as a manufactured diversion.)            This scandal makes blatant the degree to which the mainstream media holds aDrudge Grudge. None of the stories in the papers today credit him for anything,, "even though the Drudge Report last weekend reported Lewinskys name and that", "her allegations were on tapes in Starrs possession. In light of that alone,", "its absurd that Mike McCurry wont even address questions that mention Drudge.", After all, he still takes questions from Time --you know, the guys whoexplained how Richard Jewell bombed the Olympics., "            Maybe Starrs expansion of his inquiry is legally hunky-dory. But think", about it: why should you have to tell the truth about anything a, "prosecutor can think to ask you about? Suppose Starr decides Bill Clintons", video rental records might be relevant--should the president have to say, "whether hes watched X-rated videos in the White House? Should the video", "delivery guy have to go to jail if he doesnt want to answer that one? Its a", little odd to realize that in this 25th anniversary year of Roe v. Wade theonly sex organ that has the constitutional right to privacy is the uterus.                                                   Return to Norma-cy, "            All the papers lead with a federal judges rejection of President Clintons", claim that executive privilege protects two of his aides from testifying to the, "Starr grand jury about laffaire Lewinsky. Also prominent at the dailies are", "large front-page pictures of Nancy Reagan at yesterdays dedication of the [$818]", million Ronald Reagan building in Washington--an unlikely tribute, notes the"Los AngelesTimes , to a president who championed limits on the federal bureaucracy.Indeed, the New York Times front-pagepicture caption reads, "Of Honors and Overruns."            The no-privilege decision by Judge Norma Johnson--actually still under sealand leaked to the papers by lawyers involved in the case (who thereby continueto flirt with sanction by Judge Johnson)--is deemed a "stunning legal defeat"for Clinton by the NYT and rated a "major victory" for Ken Starr by"USA Hello .The Washington Post and the NYT add that Judge, "Johnson also ruled against Clintons invocation of attorney-client privilege to", shield his top aides, holding that Clinton could not use government-paidlawyers to aid his defense in a criminal investigation. And the NYT andLAT point out that a White House bid to have some protections extendedto conversations between Hillary Clinton and some aides was also turned down.The NYT observes that the ruling dims the chances for the as-yet-unheardWhite House claim that Secret Service agents are also cloaked in a specialprivilege.            At one point, USAT quotes lawyer Ted Olson expressing no surprise atthe decision, describing him as a "former Reagan" official. But thischaracterization makes Olson seem a little too detached from the matter athand, for in fact Olson is a close friend and political supporter of, "Starrs.",             The NYT front notes the advent of a new weapon available to airplane hijackers, terrorists andassassins--a three-inch pistol posing as a key chain. It costs only [$20] and isnot detected by some metal detectors or airport X-ray machines. The paperreports that one was seized by airport security in Athens last week, and thatothers have been confiscated at airports in England and Australia.
